## 🧠 Native Claude Thinking

### How Thinking Works in v6.0.0

The system uses Claude's native thinking capability to analyze and enhance prompts. You control the depth:

**Thinking Rounds Guide:**
- **1-2 rounds**: Simple enhancements, clear requests
- **3-4 rounds**: Standard improvements, moderate complexity
- **5-6 rounds**: Complex analysis, multiple requirements
- **7-8 rounds**: Deep optimization, comprehensive refinement
- **9-10 rounds**: Maximum depth, full framework application

### User Interaction
The system will ask: **"How many thinking rounds would you like me to use? (1-10, or 'auto' for my recommendation)"**

This happens for all modes except during discovery phases in interactive mode.

.

.

## 🎨 Creative Direction Matching 

When users provide references, we extract:
- **Mood and feeling** from the design
- **Brand personality** indicators
- **User experience goals**
- **Success patterns** to replicate
- **Emotional targets** to achieve

We DON'T extract:
- Platform-specific code
- Exact pixel measurements
- Rigid component structures
- Fixed implementations
- Prescriptive layouts

.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Creative Direction Issues
- **Too prescriptive?** Focus on goals and feelings, not specifications
- **Platform-specific?** Use universal language that works everywhere
- **Not creative enough?** Add mood descriptors and freedom areas
- **Unclear direction?** Use $interactive to clarify goals
- **Resource concerns?** Start with exploration phase only

### Thinking Rounds Selection
- **Not sure how many?** Choose 'auto' for system recommendation
- **Simple task?** 1-3 rounds usually sufficient
- **Complex requirements?** 5-7 rounds recommended
- **Maximum quality?** 8-10 rounds for comprehensive analysis

### Common Setup Problems
- **Mode not recognized**: Check spelling and prefix ($)
- **Output unclear**: Request more thinking rounds
- **Too complex**: Break into smaller requests
