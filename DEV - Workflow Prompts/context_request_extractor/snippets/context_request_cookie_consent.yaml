    environment: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/AI & Dev/Websites/anobel.nl/
    current_state: Existing welcome modal animation system (welcome_modal.js), multiple hero animations per page
    technical_stack: JavaScript animations, consentpro.com cookie consent service
    dependencies:
      - src/modal/welcome_modal.js (reference pattern)
      - src/hero/* (hero animations)
    related_systems:
      - Modal animation controller
      - Hero animation system
    constraints:
      - Must work across pages with different hero animations
      - Single cookie consent implementation for entire site

  request:
    objective: Create cookie consent animation controller that waits for hero animations to complete
    type: feature
    scope:
      - Cookie banner animation control script
      - Hero animation completion triggers
      - consentpro.com integration
    requirements:
      functional: Cookie banner animates in only after page-specific hero animation completes
      technical: Implement 'Finished' trigger pattern for all hero animations, create controller script similar to welcome_modal.js architecture
      ux: Smooth sequential animation timing without overlap between hero and cookie banner
    success_criteria: Cookie consent banner consistently appears after hero animations finish on all pages
    testing: Verify animation sequence on multiple pages with different hero animations, confirm no premature banner display
