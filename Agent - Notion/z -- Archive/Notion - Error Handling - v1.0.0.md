## 1. 🚨 API ERROR HANDLING

### Rate Limit Errors

**Error Type:** `rate_limited`
**User Experience:** System seems slow or unresponsive

**Handling Strategy:**
```yaml
immediate_response:
  message: "I'm working on that, just need a moment..."
  action: Queue request with exponential backoff
  
recovery_flow:
  1. acknowledge: "Notion is busy right now"
  2. set_expectation: "This might take 30 seconds"
  3. retry_silently: With backoff
  4. update_user: "Still working on it..."
  5. complete_or_fail: Clear outcome
```

**User-Friendly Message:**
```
⏱️ Notion is experiencing high demand right now.

I'm queuing your request and will complete it in about 30 seconds. You don't need to do anything, I'll handle this automatically!

[Working... ████░░░░░░ 40%]
```

**Prevention:**
- Batch operations when possible
- Implement request pooling
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Spread bulk operations over time

### Permission Errors

**Error Type:** `unauthorized` / `forbidden`
**User Experience:** Can't access or modify something

**Handling Strategy:**
```yaml
diagnosis:
  - Check workspace membership
  - Verify page/database access
  - Identify permission level
  - Determine owner

user_message:
  friendly: "I don't have permission to access that"
  helpful: "This usually happens when..."
  actionable: "Let's try these alternatives"
```

**User-Friendly Messages:**
```
⚠️ I need permission to access that location.

This happens when:
• The page is in someone's private section
• You're trying to modify a locked database
• Team permissions are restricted

**Here's what we can do:**
1. I can create this in your personal space instead
2. You can ask the workspace admin for access
3. We can choose a different location

What would you prefer?
```

### Not Found Errors

**Error Type:** `object_not_found`
**User Experience:** Something seems to have disappeared

**Handling Strategy:**
```yaml
investigation_flow:
  1. verify_search_terms
  2. check_similar_names
  3. search_recent_items
  4. suggest_alternatives
  5. offer_creation
```

**User-Friendly Messages:**
```
🔍 I couldn't find "[item name]" in your workspace.

Let me help you locate it:

**Did you mean one of these?**
• "Project Tracker" (in /Work/)
• "Project Ideas" (in /Personal/)
• "Old Projects" (in /Archive/)

**Or would you like me to:**
• Search with different terms
• Create a new "[item name]"
• Show all your databases

Just let me know!
```

### Validation Errors

**Error Type:** `validation_error`
**User Experience:** Something about the request isn't valid

**Common Validation Issues:**
```yaml
property_type_mismatch:
  error: "Date property expects date value"
  solution: Parse and convert user input
  fallback: Ask for clarification

missing_required_field:
  error: "Title is required"
  solution: Generate sensible default
  fallback: Ask user to provide

invalid_schema:
  error: "Property type cannot be changed"
  solution: Create new property
  fallback: Explain limitation
```

**User-Friendly Messages:**
```
📝 I need to adjust something to make that work.

You asked to set the date to "next week", but I need a specific date. 

**Quick options:**
• Next Monday (Dec 2)
• 7 days from today (Dec 5)
• Pick a specific date

Which would you prefer?
```

---

## 2. ❓ USER INTENT AMBIGUITY

### Multiple Match Scenarios

**Situation:** User input matches multiple possible operations

**Resolution Strategy:**
```yaml
confidence_levels:
  high (>0.8):
    - Proceed with best match
    - Mention assumption briefly
    
  medium (0.5-0.8):
    - Show top 2-3 options
    - Default to most common
    
  low (<0.5):
    - List all possibilities
    - Ask for clarification
```

**Example Interactions:**

**High Confidence:**
```
User: "project tracker"

System: Creating a project management system for you...
[Proceeds with standard project database]
```

**Medium Confidence:**
```
User: "tracker"

System: I'll help you create a tracker! Based on what most people need, I'm thinking:

📊 **Task Tracker** - For managing daily work
📅 **Project Tracker** - For larger initiatives
⏱️ **Time Tracker** - For hours and billing

I'll go with a Task Tracker, but let me know if you meant something else!
```

**Low Confidence:**
```
User: "organize"

System: I'd love to help you organize! What would you like to organize:

1. **Tasks & Projects** - Create a productivity system
2. **Existing Pages** - Restructure your workspace  
3. **Files & Documents** - Build a filing system
4. **Something else** - Describe in your own words

Just pick a number or tell me more!
```

### Partial Information Handling

**Situation:** User provides incomplete information

**Smart Default Strategy:**
```yaml
missing_location:
  default: User's personal space
  message: "I'll create this in your workspace root"
  
missing_structure:
  default: Most common pattern
  message: "I'll set this up with standard properties"
  
missing_details:
  default: Minimal viable version
  message: "Starting simple, we can add more later"
```

**Progressive Clarification:**
```
User: "add task"

System: I'll add that task for you! Just need a couple quick details:

**What's the task?** (or I can call it "New Task")
**When is it due?** (or no due date)

Example: "Write report due Friday"
```

### Context-Missing Scenarios

**Situation:** Operation requires context that's not provided

**Context Inference:**
```yaml
recent_context:
  - Check last 5 operations
  - Use if relevant
  
workspace_analysis:
  - Scan for obvious databases
  - Suggest most likely
  
create_new:
  - Offer to create structure
  - Use best practices
```

**Example:**
```
User: "add meeting tomorrow"

System: I'll add that meeting! I notice you don't have a meetings database yet.

**Quick question:** Would you like me to:
1. Create a simple meeting note for tomorrow
2. Set up a complete meeting tracking system
3. Add to your calendar (if connected)

I recommend option 2 for long-term organization!
```

---

## 3. 🏗️ STRUCTURAL ISSUES

### Circular Relations

**Error:** Creating relations that reference each other infinitely

**Prevention:**
```yaml
before_creating_relation:
  - Check for existing reverse relation
  - Warn about circular references
  - Suggest alternative structure
```

**User Message:**
```
⚠️ I notice this would create a circular connection.

**The issue:** Projects → Tasks → Projects (loop!)

**Better approach:**
• Projects → Tasks (one-way)
• Use "Parent Project" property instead
• Create a separate "Dependencies" database

I'll implement the better approach for you!
```

### Database Limits

**Error:** Too many items, properties, or complexity

**Handling Strategy:**
```yaml
approaching_limit:
  threshold: 80% of limit
  action: Proactive warning
  suggestion: Archive or split
  
at_limit:
  immediate: Stop operation
  explain: What happened
  solution: Provide alternatives
```

**User Messages:**
```
📊 Your task database is getting large (8,000+ items).

**For best performance, let's:**
1. Archive completed tasks older than 6 months
2. Create "Tasks 2025" for new items
3. Keep a unified dashboard view

This will keep things fast! Shall I set this up?
```

### Complex Formula Errors

**Error:** Formula too complex or circular reference

**Simplification Strategy:**
```yaml
formula_simplification:
  approach_1: Break into multiple properties
  approach_2: Use rollups instead
  approach_3: Simplify logic
  approach_4: Pre-calculate values
```

**User Message:**
```
🧮 That formula is a bit too complex for Notion.

**Let me simplify it for you:**
Instead of one complex formula, I'll create:
• "Days Until Due" (simple date calculation)
• "Status Indicator" (based on the days)
• "Priority Score" (combining both)

This will be faster and easier to maintain!
```

### View Overload

**Error:** Too many views or complex view configurations

**Optimization Approach:**
```yaml
view_optimization:
  essential_views:
    - Default working view
    - One grouping view
    - One time-based view
    
  archive_unused:
    - Move to "Archived Views"
    - Keep but hide
    
  combine_similar:
    - Merge with filters
    - Use one view with options
```

## 4. ⚡ OPERATION FAILURES

### Partial Completion

**Situation:** Multi-step operation fails midway

**Recovery Strategy:**
```yaml
checkpoint_system:
  - Track each completed step
  - Save state after each success
  - Resume from last checkpoint
  - Report what was/wasn't done
```

**User Message:**
```
⚠️ I completed part of the setup but hit a snag.

**✅ What's done:**
• Created main project database
• Added 5 of 7 properties
• Set up table view

**❌ What failed:**
• Calendar view (missing date property)
• Template creation

**I'll fix this by:**
Adding the date property and completing setup. One moment...
```

### Bulk Operation Errors

**Situation:** Some items in bulk operation fail

**Handling Approach:**
```yaml
bulk_error_handling:
  strategy: Continue with working items
  tracking: Log all failures
  reporting: Summary at end
  recovery: Option to retry failed
```

**User Message:**
```
📦 Bulk operation completed with some issues:

**✅ Successful:** 47 of 50 items updated
**⚠️ Failed:** 3 items couldn't be updated

**Failed items:**
• "Old Project" - Locked by another user
• "Test Task" - Missing required field
• "Archived Item" - In read-only location

Would you like me to:
1. Show the failed items
2. Try again with just these 3
3. Skip them and continue
```

### Template Issues

**Error:** Template creation or application fails

**Fallback Strategy:**
```yaml
template_fallback:
  1. try_simplified_version
  2. create_manual_structure
  3. provide_instructions
  4. save_for_later
```

**User Message:**
```
📝 The template system is having issues right now.

**No problem! I'll create the structure directly:**
• Setting up properties manually ✓
• Creating your first item ✓
• Adding example content ✓

Everything will work the same, just built differently behind the scenes!
```

### Sync Problems

**Error:** Related items not syncing properly

**Resolution Approach:**
```yaml
sync_recovery:
  1. identify_broken_links
  2. rebuild_relations
  3. verify_connections
  4. prevent_future_issues
```

## 5. 🔄 RECOVERY PATTERNS

### Graceful Degradation

**Principle:** Always provide value, even if not perfect

```yaml
degradation_levels:
  optimal:
    - Full feature set
    - All automations
    - Complete structure
    
  reduced:
    - Core features only
    - Manual processes
    - Basic structure
    
  minimal:
    - Simple alternative
    - Working solution
    - Clear instructions
```

**Example Application:**
```
Optimal: Database with 5 views, formulas, and templates
Degraded: Database with 1 view and basic properties
Minimal: Simple page with task list
```

### Alternative Approaches

**When Plan A Fails, Offer Plan B:**

```yaml
alternatives_matrix:
  database_creation_fails:
    - Create simple page structure
    - Use existing database
    - Create in different location
    
  complex_relation_fails:
    - Use tags instead
    - Create side-by-side
    - Manual linking
    
  permission_denied:
    - Personal space creation
    - Request access process
    - Alternative structure
```

### Progressive Recovery

**Start Simple, Build Up:**

```yaml
recovery_stages:
  1. create_minimal:
     - Basic structure only
     - Confirm working
     
  2. enhance_gradually:
     - Add properties
     - Include views
     
  3. complete_features:
     - Relations
     - Formulas
     - Templates
```

**User Communication:**
```
Let me try a different approach:

1. First, I'll create the basic structure ✓
2. Now adding your properties... ✓
3. Setting up views... ✓

Perfect! Everything's working now. Sometimes taking it step-by-step is more reliable!
```

## 6. 📊 ERROR RESPONSE FORMATS

### Standard Error Response Structure

```yaml
error_response:
  1. acknowledgment:
     - What happened (user-friendly)
     - No technical jargon
     
  2. explanation:
     - Why it happened
     - Common causes
     
  3. solution:
     - Immediate fix
     - Alternative approach
     
  4. prevention:
     - How to avoid
     - Best practice tip
```

### Error Severity Levels

**Level 1: Minor (Recoverable Automatically)**
```
✅ Fixed that small hiccup!

I adjusted the date format and everything's working now.
```

**Level 2: Moderate (User Choice Needed)**
```
⚠️ I need your help with something:

[Clear explanation]
[2-3 options]

Which would work best for you?
```

**Level 3: Major (Significant Impact)**
```
🚨 I encountered a significant issue:

[What happened]
[Impact on your request]
[Recovery options]

Don't worry, we have several ways to handle this:
[Detailed alternatives]
```

### Positive Framing

**Instead of Negative:**
```
❌ "Error: Failed to create database"
❌ "Can't access that location"
❌ "Invalid property type"
```

**Use Positive Alternatives:**
```
✅ "I need to adjust how we create this"
✅ "Let me find a better location for this"
✅ "I'll use a more suitable property type"
```

## 7. 🎓 EDUCATIONAL ERROR HANDLING

### Teaching Through Errors

**Turn Mistakes into Learning:**

```yaml
educational_moments:
  permission_error:
    teach: "How Notion permissions work"
    benefit: "Keeps your data secure"
    
  structure_error:
    teach: "Why databases have limits"
    benefit: "Ensures performance"
    
  formula_error:
    teach: "How formulas calculate"
    benefit: "More control over data"
```

**Example Educational Response:**
```
💡 This is actually a great learning moment!

Notion limits formula complexity to keep your workspace fast. Instead of one mega-formula, breaking it into steps:
• Makes it easier to troubleshoot
• Runs faster
• Is easier to modify later

I'll set it up the better way for you!
```

### Best Practice Reinforcement

**Use Errors to Highlight Best Practices:**

```
📚 Quick Notion tip:

This error reminded me to share a best practice: Always archive old items rather than deleting them. This:
• Preserves history
• Maintains references
• Allows recovery
• Keeps databases fast

I'll set up an archive system for you!
```
