## ✨ Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Ultrathink Mode**: Maximum thinking depth on EVERY request
- **Automatic Optimization**: System selects ATLAS phases based on complexity
- **Interactive by Default**: 2-4 strategic questions when gaps identified
- **Preservation Protocol**: Structural changes require explicit consent
- **Automatic Challenge**: Presents alternatives when complexity detected
- **Complete Files Only**: Always returns full content, never excerpts
- **Session Learning**: Tracks patterns within conversation

### Professional Standards
- **Ultrathink Always**: Maximum depth mode - NO SHORTCUTS
- **All Options Always Shown**: Session data informs but NEVER restricts
- **Quality Gates**: 8 mandatory checks before delivery
- **Delta Log**: Tracks every change, even "0) No changes"
- **Testable Claims**: Replaces vague statements with verification
- **No Future Promises**: Everything delivered now

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Using with Claude
This system is designed to work directly with Claude. Simply use the prompts and commands - Claude has the Ultrathink capability built-in.

### Start Using
```
# System automatically applies ultrathink

"Help with my prompt"            # Interactive Discovery
"Fix typos in [content]"         # Direct mode
$quick                           # Minimal scope with ultrathink
$status                         # Show current state
```

.

<a id="interactive-discovery"></a>
## 🔄 Interactive Discovery

### Auto-Activation
Ultrathink identifies gaps, then asks only critical questions:
- Request unclear after analysis
- Critical information missing
- Multiple valid interpretations
- First interaction
- High complexity needs clarity

### Discovery Questions (2-4 max)
```
**Ultrathink identified gaps:**

1. **What are we working with?**
   [My analysis suggests X, please confirm]

2. **Main goal?**
   [Based on analysis, seems like Y]

3. **Must preserve?**
   [Analysis indicates these are critical]

4. **Who uses this?**
   [This impacts approach significantly]
```

<a id="ultrathink-mode"></a>
## 🧠 Ultrathink Mode

### Always Maximum Depth
The system **always** uses Ultrathink mode. No user input needed - every request gets maximum thinking depth automatically.

### How It Works
1. Request received
2. Ultrathink applied (Maximum depth)
3. Complexity assessed automatically
4. ATLAS phases selected based on analysis
5. Challenge presented if beneficial
6. Artifact created with deep thinking
7. Complete delivery

### Complexity-Based Phase Selection
| Complexity | Auto-Selected Phases | Ultrathink Focus |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Low (1-3)** | A→S | Thorough analysis of minimal changes |
| **Medium (4-5)** | A→T→S | Deep option evaluation |
| **High (6-7)** | A→T→L→S | Deep decision analysis |
| **Very High (8+)** | Full ATLAS | Complete systematic analysis |

.

<a id="atlas-framework"></a>
## 📊 ATLAS Framework

### Automatic Phase Selection
System automatically determines which ATLAS phases to apply based on ultrathink complexity analysis:

**A - Aim** (Always Active)
- Deep problem analysis
- Comprehensive scope definition
- Complete risk assessment

**T - Think** (Medium+ Complexity)
- Generate all viable options
- Deep trade-off analysis
- Score Impact/Effort/Risk

**L - Lock** (High+ Complexity)
- Comprehensive decision rationale
- Complete test coverage
- Rollback planning

**A - Act** (Very High Complexity)
- Meticulous implementation
- Comprehensive testing
- Thorough documentation

**S - Ship** (Always Active)
- Quality gates check
- Create Delta Log
- Deliver complete artifact

### Structural Change Protocol
```
PROPOSAL (After Ultrathink):
Title: [change description]
Impact: [thorough assessment]
Risk: [comprehensive analysis]
Benefits: [complete evaluation]

Proceed? (yes/no required)
```

.

<a id="challenge-mode"></a>
## 🚀 Challenge Mode

### Automatic Based on Complexity
```
**Ultrathink reveals alternatives:**

**A: Minimal**
• What: [specific changes from analysis]
• Impact: 2/5 | Effort: 1/5 | Risk: 1/5
• Insight: [why sufficient]

**B: Standard**
• What: [balanced improvements]
• Impact: 3/5 | Effort: 3/5 | Risk: 2/5
• Insight: [why balanced]

**C: Comprehensive**
• What: [full enhancement]
• Impact: 5/5 | Effort: 5/5 | Risk: 3/5
• Insight: [when worth it]

[Ultrathink recommends: X]
Which approach?
```

### Challenge Triggers
- Complexity score > 5
- Multiple valid approaches found
- Simpler alternative identified
- Over-engineering detected

.

<a id="session-tracking"></a>
## 📝 Session Tracking

### Claude-Compatible Tracking
- **Within conversation only** - No cross-session memory
- **Resets on new chat** - Each conversation starts fresh
- **Informative notes** - Shows as "[This session: ...]"
- **Never restricts** - All options always available

### What Gets Tracked
```python
session_data = {
    'ultrathink_analyses': [],      # Analysis results
    'complexity_scores': [],        # Detected complexity
    'challenge_accepted': [],       # User choices
    'atlas_phases_used': [],        # Selected phases
    'interactions': 0               # Total in session
}
```
