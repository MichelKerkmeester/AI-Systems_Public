## 7. üì± LOVABLE APP DEVELOPMENT

### 7.1 Simple App
**Before:** "create todo app"
**After ($lovable mode):** 
```
I need a todo application with:
- Frontend: React with React Router for navigation
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with ShadCN components
- Backend: Supabase for data persistence
- Auth: Email/password authentication using Supabase Auth

Core features:
1. User registration and login with email verification
2. Create, read, update, delete todos with real-time sync
3. Mark todos as complete/incomplete with visual feedback
4. Filter todos (all, active, completed) with URL state
5. Due dates with overdue highlighting
6. Categories/tags with color coding

Start with the main dashboard containing:
- Header with user email, logout button, and theme toggle
- Todo input form with title, due date, and category selection
- Todo list with checkboxes, edit/delete buttons, and swipe actions on mobile
- Filter tabs with counts (All: X, Active: Y, Completed: Z)
- Empty state illustration when no todos exist

Database schema:
```sql
-- todos table
id uuid primary key
user_id uuid references auth.users
title text not null
completed boolean default false
due_date timestamp
category text
created_at timestamp default now()
updated_at timestamp default now()

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE todos ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own todos" 
  ON todos FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

Knowledge Base context:
- Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind breakpoints
- Dark mode support with system preference detection
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on error
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+N for new, Esc to cancel)

Implementation phases:
1. Setup project with auth pages (login/signup)
2. Create dashboard layout with responsive navigation
3. Implement todo CRUD operations with Supabase
4. Add filtering and real-time subscriptions
5. Polish with animations and error handling
```

### 7.2 E-commerce Features
**Before:** "add shopping cart"
**After ($lovable mode):**
```
[Chat Mode Planning]
Analyze current e-commerce setup:
- Product catalog already implemented
- User authentication via Supabase
- Stripe integration needed

Shopping cart architecture:
1. Zustand for global cart state
2. LocalStorage for persistence
3. Supabase table for saved carts
4. Guest checkout support

[Default Mode Implementation]
Add shopping cart functionality to existing e-commerce site:

Frontend Components:
- CartProvider (Zustand store) with persistence
- CartIcon with animated item count badge
- CartDrawer (sliding panel from right)
- CartItem with quantity controls and price calculation
- CheckoutButton with loading states

Features:
1. Add to cart with variant/size selection
2. Quantity updates with min/max validation
3. Remove items with undo notification
4. Real-time price calculation with tax
5. Save cart for logged-in users
6. Cart migration from guest to user on login
7. Stock validation before checkout

Supabase Schema:
```sql
-- carts table
id uuid primary key
user_id uuid references auth.users
items jsonb not null default '[]'
updated_at timestamp default now()

-- cart_items view for analytics
CREATE VIEW cart_items AS
SELECT 
  user_id,
  jsonb_array_elements(items) as item,
  updated_at
FROM carts;
```

UI Specifications:
- Drawer width: 400px desktop, full-width mobile
- Show: product image, name, variant, price, quantity
- Sticky footer with subtotal and checkout button
- Loading skeleton during cart operations
- Toast notifications for cart actions

Constraints:
- Don't modify existing ProductCard components
- Preserve current routing structure
- Keep Stripe integration separate

Mobile optimizations:
- Swipe to remove items
- Bottom sheet on mobile
- Large touch targets (44px minimum)
```

### 7.3 SaaS Dashboard
**Before:** "create admin dashboard"
**After ($lovable mode):**
```
Build a SaaS admin dashboard with:

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React with React Router v6
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + ShadCN components
- Backend: Supabase with RLS policies
- Charts: Recharts for data visualization
- State: Zustand for global state management

Core Features:
1. Multi-tenant architecture with organization switching
2. Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, User)
3. Real-time metrics dashboard with KPIs
4. User management with invite system
5. Billing integration with Stripe
6. Activity logs with filtering

Start with main dashboard page:
- Top bar: Organization selector, user menu, notifications
- Sidebar: Collapsible navigation with icons
- Main area: 
  - KPI cards (MRR, Active Users, Churn Rate, Growth)
  - Charts (Revenue trend, User activity, Feature usage)
  - Recent activity feed
  - Quick actions panel

Database Structure:
```sql
-- organizations
id, name, plan, stripe_customer_id, created_at

-- organization_users
organization_id, user_id, role, joined_at

-- activity_logs
id, organization_id, user_id, action, metadata, created_at
```

Implementation Order:
1. Auth flow with organization selection
2. Dashboard layout with responsive sidebar
3. KPI calculations and real-time updates
4. User management CRUD operations
5. Stripe billing integration
6. Activity logging system

Mobile Considerations:
- Bottom navigation instead of sidebar
- Swipeable KPI cards
- Simplified chart views
- Touch-optimized data tables
```

### 7.4 Mobile-First Design
**Before:** "make responsive"
**After ($lovable mode):**
```
Optimize [LandingPage] component for complete mobile-first responsiveness:

Breakpoint Strategy:
- Mobile (default): < 640px
- Tablet (sm): 640px - 768px  
- Desktop (md): 768px - 1024px
- Large (lg): 1024px+

Specific Adjustments:

Mobile (default):
- Stack all sections vertically
- Full-width CTAs with 48px height
- Hamburger menu with slide-out drawer
- Single column grid for features
- Touch-friendly spacing (min 8px between elements)

Tablet (sm:):
- 2-column grid for features
- Side-by-side CTAs where appropriate
- Increase font sizes by 10%
- Show abbreviated navigation

Desktop (md: and lg:):
- 3-column feature grid
- Horizontal navigation bar
- Side-by-side hero content
- Sticky header with backdrop blur

Implementation approach:
1. Start with mobile styles (no breakpoint prefix)
2. Add tablet styles with sm: prefix
3. Add desktop styles with md: and lg: prefixes
4. Test at each breakpoint using browser DevTools

Constraints:
- Use only Tailwind utilities (no custom CSS)
- Preserve all functionality and features
- Maintain WCAG AA accessibility standards
- Keep loading performance under 3s on 3G

Testing checklist:
- [ ] Portrait phone (375px)
- [ ] Landscape phone (667px)
- [ ] Tablet (768px)
- [ ] Desktop (1024px+)
- [ ] Touch interactions work
- [ ] No horizontal scroll at any breakpoint
```

### 7.5 Debugging Workflow
**Before:** "fix error"
**After ($lovable mode):**
```
[Chat Mode - Initial Investigation]
Analyze this Supabase authentication error:
"Error: Invalid JWT: payload malformed"

Context:
- Occurs after user login attempt
- Works locally but fails in production
- Started after deploying new auth flow

Use chain-of-thought reasoning to identify possible causes:
1. Environment variable mismatch?
2. Supabase project URL/anon key issues?
3. Token expiration settings?
4. CORS configuration?

[After Chat Mode Analysis]

[Default Mode - Implementation]
Fix the JWT authentication error identified above:

Solution steps:
1. Verify Supabase environment variables:
   - Check REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL matches production
   - Confirm REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is correct
   - Ensure no trailing slashes or spaces

2. Update auth configuration:
```javascript
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
  {
    auth: {
      persistSession: true,
      detectSessionInUrl: true,
      autoRefreshToken: true,
      storage: window.localStorage
    }
  }
)
```

3. Add error boundary for auth failures:
   - Catch JWT errors specifically
   - Clear invalid tokens from localStorage
   - Redirect to login with error message

4. Implement token refresh logic:
   - Check token expiry before API calls
   - Refresh if expiring within 60 seconds
   - Handle refresh failures gracefully

Testing approach:
- Clear browser storage
- Test login flow
- Verify token in DevTools
- Check network requests for auth headers
```
