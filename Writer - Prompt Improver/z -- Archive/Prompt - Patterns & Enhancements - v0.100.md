## 2. ‚ö° QUICK ENHANCEMENT CHECKLIST

When enhancing any prompt, check:
- [ ] Specificity: Numbers, metrics, concrete details
- [ ] Context: Background, constraints, assumptions
- [ ] Format: Clear output structure and style
- [ ] Examples: 1-3 samples of desired result
- [ ] Scope: Clear boundaries and limitations

## 3. üìê CORE PATTERNS WITH ENHANCEMENTS

### 3.1 Expert Analysis Pattern
**Best for:** Data interpretation, research evaluation, strategic assessment

```
You are a [specific expert role] with expertise in [domain].
Analyze [subject] considering:
1. [Critical factor 1]
2. [Critical factor 2]
3. [Critical factor 3]

Focus on [priority].
Assume [audience knowledge level].
Format: [structure with examples]
If uncertain about [X], state assumptions clearly.
```

**Enhancement Options:**
- [ ] Add specificity: Include exact metrics, timeframes, or quantities
- [ ] Add context: Provide relevant background or constraints
- [ ] Add reasoning: Request step-by-step analysis process
- [ ] Add validation: Include accuracy checks or confidence levels
- [ ] Add examples: Show sample of desired analysis depth

**Example Enhancement:**
- **Basic:** "Analyze this data"
- **Enhanced:** "As a data scientist specializing in user behavior, analyze this e-commerce funnel for Q4 2024. Identify the top 3 drop-off points with statistical significance (p<0.05). Format: Executive summary (200 words) + detailed findings with visualizations."

---

### 3.2 Structured Creation Pattern
**Best for:** Content generation, documentation, creative deliverables

```
Create [specific deliverable] for [target audience].
Requirements:
- Length: [exact count/range]
- Style: [tone with example]
- Must include: [elements]
- Must avoid: [exclusions]
- Success looks like: [concrete example]

Think step-by-step, then produce the final output.
```

**Enhancement Options:**
- [ ] Add structure: Specify sections, headers, or organization
- [ ] Add constraints: Set boundaries on scope or content
- [ ] Add quality criteria: Define what makes output excellent
- [ ] Add format specs: Markdown, bullets, tables, etc.
- [ ] Add iteration: Request draft ‚Üí review ‚Üí final process

**Example Enhancement:**
- **Basic:** "Write about dogs"
- **Enhanced:** "Create a 500-word beginner's guide to choosing a dog breed. Target: First-time owners in apartments. Include: 5 suitable breeds with pros/cons, space requirements, and monthly costs. Format: Intro + breed profiles + decision checklist. Tone: Friendly but informative."

---

### 3.3 Problem-Solving Pattern
**Best for:** Troubleshooting, optimization, strategic solutions

```
Help solve: [specific problem]
Context: [relevant background]
Constraints: [hard limits]
Resources: [available tools/data]
Success criteria: [measurable outcome]

Approach:
1. Diagnose root cause
2. Generate 3 solutions
3. Evaluate trade-offs
4. Recommend best option with rationale
```

**Enhancement Options:**
- [ ] Add urgency: Specify timeline or priority level
- [ ] Add stakeholders: Include who's affected and how
- [ ] Add history: What's been tried before
- [ ] Add risks: Potential negative outcomes to avoid
- [ ] Add implementation: Include execution roadmap

**Example Enhancement:**
- **Basic:** "Fix slow website"
- **Enhanced:** "As a performance engineer, diagnose why our e-commerce site loads in 8+ seconds (target: <3s). Current stack: React/Node/PostgreSQL, 50k daily users. Provide 3 solutions ranked by implementation effort vs. impact, with specific metrics and 30-day implementation plan."

---

### 3.4 Framework Generation Pattern
**Best for:** Creating systems, methodologies, structured approaches

```
Design a [framework type] framework for [specific purpose].
Target users: [who will implement this]
Core objectives: [what it should achieve]
Constraints: [limitations or requirements]

Framework must be:
- Actionable: Clear steps to follow
- Scalable: Works for [scope range]
- Memorable: Easy to communicate
- Flexible: Adaptable to [variations]

Include:
1. Core principles (3-5)
2. Implementation phases
3. Success metrics
4. Common pitfalls
5. Visual representation (ASCII if helpful)
```

**Enhancement Options:**
- [ ] Add components: Specify required framework elements
- [ ] Add examples: Include use case scenarios
- [ ] Add tools: Templates or worksheets to support
- [ ] Add validation: How to test framework effectiveness
- [ ] Add evolution: How framework adapts over time

**Example Enhancement:**
- **Basic:** "Create productivity framework"
- **Enhanced:** "Design a time-management framework for remote software developers juggling multiple projects. Include: Daily/weekly/monthly rhythms, focus time protection, async communication protocols, and burnout prevention. Make it compatible with Agile workflows. Provide implementation checklist and tracking template."

---

### 3.5 Progressive Architecture Pattern
**Best for:** Multi-stage systems, complex workflows, AI architectures

```
Create a [number]-stage [system type] for [purpose].

Stage structure:
- Stage 1: [Foundation/Initialization]
- Stage 2: [Development/Expansion]
- Stage 3: [Integration/Optimization]
- Stage [N]: [Mastery/Evolution]

For each stage, define:
1. Entry criteria
2. Core activities
3. Exit criteria
4. Deliverables
5. Progression triggers

Include feedback loops and adaptation mechanisms.
```

**Enhancement Options:**
- [ ] Add metrics: KPIs for each stage
- [ ] Add timeline: Expected duration per stage
- [ ] Add resources: What's needed at each level
- [ ] Add governance: Decision points and approvals
- [ ] Add rollback: How to handle stage failures

## 4. üí° PATTERN COMBINATIONS

### 4.1 Analysis + Creation
First analyze the situation, then create appropriate content:
```
Part 1: Analyze [current state] identifying [key issues].
Part 2: Based on analysis, create [solution/content] that addresses top 3 findings.
```

### 4.2 Problem + Framework
Diagnose issue, then build systematic solution:
```
Part 1: Diagnose [problem] and identify root causes.
Part 2: Design a framework to prevent recurrence and handle similar issues.
```

### 4.3 Progressive + Creation
Build content that evolves through stages:
```
Create [deliverable] in 3 progressive versions:
- Basic: Core concepts only
- Intermediate: Add nuance and edge cases
- Advanced: Include optimization and scaling
```
