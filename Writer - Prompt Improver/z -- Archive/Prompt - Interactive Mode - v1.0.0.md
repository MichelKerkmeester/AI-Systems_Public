## 1. 📋 Overview

The `$interactive` mode is a conversational approach to prompt enhancement that asks targeted questions to gather missing information before creating an optimized prompt. It serves both as a welcoming entry point for new users and a guided refinement tool for anyone wanting help crafting effective prompts.

---

## 2. 🚀 Activation Triggers

### Automatic Activation
- **First-time users**: When no previous prompts detected
- **Brief prompts**: When prompt <10 words, suggest with: "Your prompt seems brief. Try $interactive for guided help!"
- **Multiple errors**: After 3+ consecutive errors
- **Confusion detected**: When user seems stuck

### Manual Activation
- `$interactive` - Start fresh
- `$interactive "prompt"` - Start with existing prompt

---

## 3. ⚙️ How Interactive Mode Works

### Conversation State Tracking

The system maintains context throughout the conversation:
- Current phase (welcome, questions, processing, delivery)
- Questions already asked
- User's answers
- Original prompt (if provided)
- Detected gaps and improvements needed

---

## 4. 🔄 Conversation Flow Phases

### Phase 1: Welcome & Assessment

**What happens:**
- System detects how user arrived at interactive mode
- Shows appropriate welcome message
- If user provided a prompt, analyzes it for gaps
- Sets conversational tone based on context

**Welcome Message Types:**

**Full Welcome (First-Time Users):**
```
🎯 **Welcome to Your Prompt Engineering Assistant!**

I'm here to transform vague requests into clear, effective AI prompts. Think of me as your personal prompt optimization consultant.

I'll guide you through creating the perfect prompt by:
1. Understanding your goal
2. Identifying key details
3. Optimizing for your target AI

**Ready to start?** Just tell me what you'd like to create, or paste a prompt you want to improve!

💡 **Quick Example:**
Instead of: "write about dogs"
I'll help you create: "Write a 500-word beginner's guide to choosing dog breeds for apartment living."
```

**Brief Welcome (Returning User):**
```
Welcome back! 👋 Let's create another great prompt together.

What would you like help with today? Just describe your goal or paste a prompt to improve.
```

**Targeted Welcome (With Prompt):**
```
I see you want to work on: "[user's prompt]"

That's a great start! Let me ask a few quick questions to make it even better.
```

### Phase 2: Intelligent Question Selection

**What happens:**
- System analyzes the prompt (or lack thereof) to identify gaps
- Selects 2-3 most critical questions based on what's missing
- Prioritizes questions that will have the biggest impact on prompt quality
- Presents questions in a friendly, conversational manner

**Question Priority Order:**
1. **Purpose** (0.9 priority) - What's the goal?
2. **Audience** (0.8 priority) - Who's it for?
3. **Format** (0.7 priority) - How should it look?
4. **Scope** (0.6 priority) - How detailed?
5. **Constraints** (0.5 priority) - Any limitations?
6. **Platform** (0.4 priority) - Which AI?
7. **Tone** (0.3 priority) - What style?

The system dynamically adjusts priorities based on the prompt type detected.

### Phase 3: Answer Processing

**What happens:**
- System collects user's answers
- Builds a comprehensive context from the responses
- Applies the CRAFT framework to structure the enhancement
- Detects and applies platform-specific optimizations
- Identifies all improvements made compared to original

**Context Building:**
The system combines:
- Original prompt (if any)
- Purpose/goal from answers
- Audience information
- Format preferences
- Scope and constraints
- Detected platform
- Tone requirements

### Phase 4: Enhanced Prompt Delivery

**What's delivered:**
1. Enhanced prompt in artifact
2. Visual improvement dashboard
3. Explanation of key changes
4. Platform-specific tips (if applicable)
5. Suggested next actions

## 6. 🔍 Gap Analysis Process

The system analyzes prompts to identify what's missing:

**What's Checked:**
- **Clear objective** - Is there a specific goal or outcome?
- **Audience indication** - Is the target user defined?
- **Format details** - Is the structure specified?
- **Scope clarity** - Is the depth/length clear?
- **Requirements** - Are constraints defined?
- **Platform mention** - Is the AI platform specified?

**Prompt Classification:**
The system also classifies prompts into types:
- Content creation (blog posts, emails, copy)
- Analysis (data, research, evaluation)
- Technical (code, debugging, architecture)
- Creative (stories, brainstorming, design)
- Problem-solving (troubleshooting, optimization)

This classification helps select the most relevant questions.
