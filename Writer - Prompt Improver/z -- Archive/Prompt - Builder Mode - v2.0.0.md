## 1. üî± OVERVIEW

Builder Mode v2.0 provides three specialized sub-modes for creating optimized PROMPTS that give ANY AI development platform creative freedom to explore design solutions while maintaining resource efficiency.

### What This Mode Does
- **Creates PROMPTS** that describe goals and requirements
- **Optimizes for resource usage** through phased implementation
- **Provides creative direction** without prescriptive details
- **Structures features** by complexity and cost
- **Flags high-cost features** for user confirmation
- **Works universally** across all AI platforms

### What This Mode Does NOT Do
- ‚ùå Specify exact HTML/CSS implementations
- ‚ùå Define rigid visual specifications
- ‚ùå Prescribe specific component structures
- ‚ùå Lock in design decisions
- ‚ùå Limit creative exploration
- ‚ùå Favor one platform over another

### Core Philosophy (Universal)
- **Describe the "what" and "why"**, not the "how"
- **Set creative direction**, not specific implementations
- **Define success criteria**, not exact solutions
- **Provide inspiration**, not prescriptions
- **Enable platform strengths**, not limitations

---

**Output**: A strategic brief for marketing sites
**Resource Usage**: Medium
**Best For**: Landing pages, portfolios, creative marketing sites
**Platforms**: All web builders (Bolt.new, Webflow, Framer, etc.)

### 2.3 App Mode (`$app`)
**Purpose**: Create PROMPTS for functional applications
**Output**: A requirements brief for full-stack apps
**Resource Usage**: Medium-High
**Best For**: SaaS platforms, dashboards, interactive tools
**Platforms**: All app builders (Cursor, Windsurf, Replit, etc.)

## 3. üí∞ RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION

### Universal Resource Strategy Template
All Builder prompts MUST include:

```
üí∞ RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:

PHASE 1 - Core Exploration (Minimal Resources):
- Focus on: [Core functionality/message]
- Success looks like: [Key outcomes]
- Creative freedom: Explore layouts and visual approaches
- Start simple, iterate based on what works
- Platform-specific: Use free tiers and built-in components

PHASE 2 - Enhancements (Moderate Resources):
- Build on successful Phase 1 patterns
- Add: [Interactive elements, refined features]
- Let AI suggest improvements based on Phase 1
- Platform-specific: Leverage premium features if available

PHASE 3 - Premium Features (High Resources - Needs Confirmation):
‚ö†Ô∏è These features will significantly increase resource usage:
- [Complex functionality requirements]
- Consider deferring unless essential
- Platform-specific: Enterprise features, custom code
Ask: "Should we explore these premium features now?"

DESIGN APPROACH:
- You have creative freedom for visual design
- Prioritize [user experience goal]
- Consider modern design trends
- Experiment with layouts that achieve [objective]
- Use platform's native strengths
```

### Resource Usage Guidelines (Platform-Agnostic)

| Low Resources | Moderate Resources | High Resources |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Core layouts | Interactive elements | Real-time features |
| Basic interactions | Forms and validation | Complex animations |
| Essential features | Enhanced UX | API integrations |
| Standard patterns | Custom interactions | Advanced logic |
| Template usage | Original designs | Custom backends |

## 5. üé® CREATIVE FREEDOM PRINCIPLES

### Universal Design Direction
Instead of specifying exact implementations, provide:
- **Mood and tone** (modern, playful, professional, minimal)
- **User feelings** (confident, inspired, productive, calm)
- **Brand personality** (innovative, trustworthy, bold, approachable)
- **Success metrics** (engagement, conversion, clarity, delight)
- **Platform strengths** (let each platform excel differently)

### Examples of Good Direction (Universal)

**Instead of**: "Use a 3-column grid with 16px spacing on Tailwind"
**Write**: "Create a clean, organized layout that showcases multiple features effectively using your platform's best practices"

**Instead of**: "Primary color #6366F1, secondary #10B981 in MUI"
**Write**: "Use a professional color scheme that conveys trust and innovation with your platform's design system"

**Instead of**: "Hero section with 64px heading in Next.js"
**Write**: "Create an impactful first impression that immediately communicates our value using modern web standards"

## 11. üö® TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues and Solutions (Universal)

#### "The design isn't what I expected on [Platform]"
**Solution**: Provide clearer goals and success criteria, not more visual specifications. Each platform should interpret creatively.

#### "It's using too many resources/credits"
**Solution**: Emphasize Phase 1 completion first. Add complexity only after validating simpler approaches work.

#### "It's too generic across platforms"
**Solution**: Add more context about brand personality and emotional goals, let each platform express uniquely.

#### "Platform X does it differently than Platform Y"
**Solution**: This is good! Each platform should leverage its strengths while achieving the same goals.
