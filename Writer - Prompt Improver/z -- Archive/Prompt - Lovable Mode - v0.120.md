## 1. 📱 OVERVIEW

Lovable Mode v2.0 provides three specialized sub-modes for creating optimized PROMPTS that give Lovable AI creative freedom to explore design solutions while maintaining credit efficiency.

### What This Mode Does
- **Creates PROMPTS** that describe goals and requirements
- **Optimizes for credit usage** through phased implementation
- **Provides creative direction** without prescriptive details

## 5. 🎨 CREATIVE FREEDOM PRINCIPLES

### Design Direction, Not Prescription
Instead of specifying exact implementations, provide:
- **Mood and tone** (modern, playful, professional, minimal)
- **User feelings** (confident, inspired, productive, calm)
- **Brand personality** (innovative, trustworthy, bold, approachable)
- **Success metrics** (engagement, conversion, clarity, delight)

### Examples of Good Direction

**Instead of**: "Use a 3-column grid with 16px spacing"
**Write**: "Create a clean, organized layout that showcases multiple features effectively"

**Instead of**: "Primary color #6366F1, secondary #10B981"
**Write**: "Use a professional color scheme that conveys trust and innovation"

**Instead of**: "Hero section with 64px heading"
**Write**: "Create an impactful first impression that immediately communicates our value"

1. **Set the context** (what and why)
2. **Define success** (outcomes, not outputs)
3. **Provide direction** (mood, not specifics)
4. **Enable exploration** (freedom within constraints)
5. **Phase implementation** (credit-conscious approach)

### Example Transformations

**Over-Specified (Old):**
"Create a hero section with #6366F1 background, 64px Helvetica heading, 3-column grid with 16px gaps, gradient overlay at 0.7 opacity"

**Creative Brief (New):**
"Create an impactful hero section that immediately conveys innovation and reliability. It should draw users in and clearly communicate our value. Feel free to explore modern design approaches that achieve this goal."

## 11. 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "The design isn't what I expected"
**Solution**: Provide clearer goals and success criteria, not more visual specifications. Guide with outcomes, not implementations.

#### "It's using too many credits"
**Solution**: Emphasize Phase 1 completion first. Add complexity only after validating simpler approaches work.

#### "It's too generic"
**Solution**: Add more context about brand personality and emotional goals, not specific design details.
