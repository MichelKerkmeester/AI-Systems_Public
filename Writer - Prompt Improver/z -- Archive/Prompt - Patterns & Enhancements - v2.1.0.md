## 6. üé® VISUAL REFERENCE PATTERNS

### 6.1 Exact Match Pattern
**Purpose:** Precisely replicate provided design

```
Create PROMPT matching provided [screenshot/mockup] EXACTLY:

VISUAL EXTRACTION:
Colors:
- Primary: #[hex] (extract from reference)
- Secondary: #[hex]
- Background: #[hex]
- Text: #[hex]

Layout:
- Structure: [grid/flex configuration]
- Columns: [number and widths]
- Spacing: [measurement system]

Components:
- [List each UI element visible]
- [Note their positions]
- [Identify repeated patterns]

Typography:
- Font family: [from reference]
- Sizes: [h1, h2, body, small]
- Weights: [regular, medium, bold]

Implementation:
Phase 1: Match static layout (Low Credit)
Phase 2: Add matching interactions (Medium)
Phase 3: Complex animations (High - Confirm)

Note: This PROMPT extracts all visual details for exact matching
```

### 6.2 Inspired-By Pattern
**Purpose:** Use reference as inspiration, not exact match

```
Create PROMPT inspired by [reference] with adaptations:

VISUAL INSPIRATION:
- Overall feel: [modern/minimal/playful]
- Color scheme: [similar palette]
- Layout concept: [general structure]

ADAPTATIONS:
- Simplify: [complex elements to remove]
- Optimize: [changes for better performance]
- Enhance: [accessibility improvements]

Credit-Conscious Changes:
- Use simpler animations
- Reduce component complexity
- Leverage standard patterns

Note: This PROMPT uses reference as guide, not exact template
```

## 7. üîß LOVABLE PLATFORM PATTERNS

**REMEMBER:** These patterns create PROMPTS, not actual implementations!

### 7.1 Lovable Prototype Pattern ($prototype)
**Purpose:** Create PROMPT for rapid visual validation

```

## 8. üí∞ CREDIT-OPTIMIZED PATTERNS

### 8.1 Minimal Credit Pattern (Lovable)
**Purpose:** Maximum savings for budget-conscious users

```
Create PROMPT for [type] - CREDIT-CONSCIOUS APPROACH:

PHASE 1 ONLY (Minimal Credits):
- Static components only
- No animations or transitions
- Basic Tailwind utilities
- Hardcoded/mock data
- No API integrations
- No real-time features
- Simple forms without validation

DEFER ALL:
- Complex interactions
- Backend integrations
- Advanced features
- Custom components

Start with: [simplest component]
Estimated credits: VERY LOW

Note: This PROMPT prioritizes extreme credit savings
```

### 8.2 Balanced Credit Pattern
**Purpose:** Good functionality with reasonable credit use

```
Create PROMPT for [type] - BALANCED APPROACH:

PHASE 1 - Essentials (Low Credit):
- Core functionality only
- Basic styling with Tailwind
- Simple authentication
- Essential CRUD operations

PHASE 2 - Enhancements (Medium Credit):

- Form validations
- Basic animations
- Search and filters

PHASE 3 - Premium (High Credit - CONFIRM FIRST):
‚ö†Ô∏è These significantly increase credits:

Note: This PROMPT balances features with credit efficiency
```

### 8.3 Reuse-Heavy Pattern
**Purpose:** Maximize use of existing code/components

```
Create PROMPT leveraging maximum reuse:

REUSE STRATEGY (Credit Savings):
1. Components:
   - All UI from ShadCN
   - Auth from Supabase UI
   - Forms from React Hook Form examples

2. Patterns:
   - Copy CRUD from documentation
   - Use standard Tailwind layouts
   - Leverage example implementations

3. Avoid Creating:
   - Custom components
   - Complex animations
   - Unique layouts
   - Custom styling

Note: This PROMPT maximizes reuse to minimize credits
```

### Important Reminders
- Always clarify: "This creates a PROMPT, not the actual [app/website/prototype]"
- Include credit optimization for all Lovable requests
- Extract visual details when references provided
- Suggest reuse opportunities
- Structure in phases for cost control
