### 7.1 Simple App PROMPT
**Before:** "create todo app"
**After ($app mode):** 
```
Create a PROMPT for developing a todo application:

üí∞ CREDIT OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:

PHASE 1 - Core MVP (Low Credit):
- Basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete todos)
- Simple email/password authentication
- Static todo list display
- Local state management only

PHASE 2 - Enhanced Features (Medium Credit):
- Categories and tags
- Due dates with calendar picker

## 10. üí∞ CREDIT OPTIMIZATION EXAMPLES

### 10.1 Minimalist Approach
**Situation:** User has limited credits
**Before:** "build full-featured dashboard"
**After:** 
```
Create a PROMPT for a minimal dashboard (CREDIT-CONSCIOUS):

PHASE 1 ONLY Implementation:
- Static layout with Tailwind
- Hardcoded data (no API calls)
- Basic styling (no animations)
- Simple components only
- No real-time features
- No integrations

Estimated credits: LOW
Future phases: Document for later implementation

Note: This PROMPT prioritizes credit savings
```

### 10.2 Reuse-Heavy Strategy
**Before:** "create custom components"
**After:**
```
Create a PROMPT leveraging existing components:

REUSE STRATEGY (Maximum Credit Savings):
- Use ShadCN components exclusively
- Copy patterns from Lovable examples
- Leverage Tailwind utilities only
- No custom CSS
- Use Supabase templates
- Copy authentication flow from docs

Components to reuse:
- Button, Card, Dialog from ShadCN
- Auth UI from Supabase
- Layout from Tailwind UI

Note: This PROMPT maximizes component reuse
```

## 12. üöÄ FULL MODE TRANSFORMATIONS

### 12.1 Complete App PROMPT Transformation
**Original:** "build project management tool"

**Phase 1 - Initial Enhancement:**
Basic CRAFT applied, but missing credit optimization

**Phase 2 - Evaluation:**
```
Score: 84/175 (48%)
Missing: Credit strategy, visual specs, reuse approach
```

**Phase 3 - Final PROMPT:**
```
Create a PROMPT for developing a project management application:

üí∞ CREDIT OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:

PHASE 1 - MVP Core (Low Credit):
- Project CRUD with simple forms
- Basic task management (no drag-drop)
- Email/password auth only
- Static Kanban view
- Local state management

PHASE 2 - Enhanced Features (Medium Credit):
- Drag-and-drop Kanban board
- User assignments and avatars
- Due dates with calendar
- Activity feed
- Search and filters

PHASE 3 - Premium Features (High Credit - Needs Confirmation):
‚ö†Ô∏è The following will significantly increase credit usage:
- Real-time collaboration (Supabase subscriptions)
- File uploads to Supabase Storage
- Email notifications (SendGrid)
- Advanced permissions system
- Time tracking
- Gantt charts
Ask: "Should I implement these now or defer to save credits?"

Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React + Vite
- UI: Tailwind CSS + ShadCN components
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- State: Zustand for global state
- Routing: React Router v6

Database Schema:
```sql
-- projects
id uuid primary key
name varchar(255) not null
description text
owner_id uuid references auth.users
created_at timestamp default now()

-- tasks
id uuid primary key
project_id uuid references projects
title varchar(255) not null
description text
status varchar(50) default 'todo'
priority integer default 0
assignee_id uuid references auth.users
due_date date
created_at timestamp default now()

-- comments
id uuid primary key
task_id uuid references tasks
user_id uuid references auth.users
content text not null
created_at timestamp default now()
```

Start with: Project dashboard showing task list

REUSE STRATEGY:
- Use ShadCN Table for task list
- Copy Kanban from React Beautiful DND examples
- Use Supabase Auth UI components
- Leverage Tailwind's prose for descriptions
- Reuse card patterns throughout

VISUAL SPECIFICATIONS (if mockup provided):
[Extract colors, layout, components from reference]

Implementation Order:
1. Setup auth with Supabase UI
2. Create project CRUD (Phase 1)
3. Add basic task management (Phase 1)
4. Implement Kanban view (Phase 2)
5. Add real-time features (Phase 3 - if approved)

Note: This is a PROMPT for developing an app, not the actual application.
The phased approach allows you to stop at any point to save credits.
```

**Remember:** Every Lovable example creates a PROMPT for building something, not the actual implementation. Always include credit optimization strategies and visual reference extraction when applicable.
