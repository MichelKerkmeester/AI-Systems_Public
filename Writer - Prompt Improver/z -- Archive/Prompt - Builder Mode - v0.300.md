## 1. 🎯 Overview

### What Builder Mode Does
- Creates **PROMPTS** describing goals and requirements
- Optimizes for **resource efficiency** through phases
- Provides **creative direction** without rigid specs
- Works **universally** across all AI platforms

### What It Does NOT Do
- ❌ Specify HTML/CSS implementations
- ❌ Define exact visual specifications
- ❌ Lock in specific frameworks
- ❌ Limit creative exploration

### Core Philosophy
**Describe the "what" and "why", not the "how"**
- Goals over specifications
- Mood over details
- Outcomes over outputs
- Universal over platform-specific

### Three Sub-Modes

| Mode | Command | Purpose | Best For | Thinking |
|------|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Prototype** | `$prototype` | Visual exploration | Concepts, UI/UX | 2-4 rounds |
| **Website** | `$website` | Conversion focus | Landing pages, marketing | 3-5 rounds |
| **App** | `$app` | Functionality | SaaS, dashboards | 4-6 rounds |

## 2. 🌐 Platform Compatibility

### Universal Platform Support

| Platform | Strengths | Best For | Optimization |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Bolt.new** | Instant deploy, full-stack | MVPs, rapid prototypes | WebContainers, Netlify |
| **MagicPatterns** | Design-first, Figma | UI exploration | Component patterns |
| **v0** | Next.js, shadcn/ui | Modern web apps | Server components |
| **Cursor/Windsurf** | AI coding, quality | Complex apps | Clean architecture |

## 3. 💰 Resource Strategy

### Three-Phase Approach (ALL Prompts Must Include)

```markdown
💰 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:

PHASE 1 - Core MVP (Minimal Resources):
- Essential: [Core functionality/message]
- Focus: [Primary user need]
- Approach: Simple, effective, testable
- Platform: Use free tiers and built-in components
- Thinking: 1-2 rounds

PHASE 2 - Enhanced Experience (Moderate Resources):
- Build on: Phase 1 validated patterns
- Add: [Improved UX, additional features]
- Optimize: Platform-specific features
- Thinking: 3-4 rounds

PHASE 3 - Premium Features (High Resources - Needs Confirmation):
⚠️ These significantly increase resource usage:
- [Complex features]
- [Advanced integrations]
- Ask: "Should we implement premium features?"
- Thinking: 5-7 rounds
```

### Resource Guidelines

| Low | Moderate | High |
|-----|----------|------|
| Core layouts | Interactive elements | Real-time features |
| Basic features | Forms, validation | Complex animations |
| Template usage | Custom designs | API integrations |
| 1-3 thinking rounds | 4-5 thinking rounds | 6-10 thinking rounds |

## 5. ✅ Best Practices

### Do's
✅ **Describe goals**, not implementations
✅ **Define success**, not specifications
✅ **Provide mood**, not exact designs
✅ **Phase complexity** for resource control
✅ **Trust AI creativity** for solutions
✅ **Embrace platform** diversity

### Don'ts
❌ Specify exact colors/fonts
❌ Define pixel measurements
❌ Lock frameworks/libraries
❌ Prescribe component structure
❌ Limit creative exploration
❌ Favor specific platforms

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Goals clearly stated?
- [ ] Success metrics defined?
- [ ] Creative freedom preserved?
- [ ] Three phases included?
- [ ] High-cost features flagged?
- [ ] Platform-agnostic language?
- [ ] Thinking rounds noted?

### Common Transformations

**Over-Specified (Wrong):**
"Create React hero with Tailwind, #6366F1 bg, 64px Inter font, 3-column grid"

**Creative Brief (Right):**
"Create impactful hero conveying innovation. Users should feel confident. Modern, professional mood. Platform chooses best implementation."

### Mode Selection

**User Says** → **Builder Mode**
- "build app" → $app
- "create website" → $website  
- "design prototype" → $prototype
- "make dashboard" → $app
- Mentions platform → Auto-detect + universal

### Success Metrics

**Good Builder PROMPT has:**
- Clear objectives (not implementations)
- User emotions (not UI details)
- Success criteria (not features list)
- Resource phases (not all upfront)
- Creative freedom (not rigid specs)
