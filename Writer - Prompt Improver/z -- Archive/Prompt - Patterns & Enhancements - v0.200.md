### 3.6 Lovable Platform Patterns

**Best for:** Rapid development on Lovable platform with specific tech stack

#### Lovable Prototype Pattern
**Purpose:** Rapid visual validation, stakeholder demos

```
Create [UI element/screen] prototype:
Visual: [style reference or description]
Interactions: [list key animations]
Screens: [main views needed]
Data: Use realistic dummy content
Focus: Visual polish over functionality
Mobile-first responsive design

Tools: React + Tailwind + Framer Motion
No backend required, use local state
```

**Enhancement Options:**
- [ ] Add visual references: Include Figma links or screenshots
- [ ] Add interaction map: User flow through screens
- [ ] Add component library: Specify UI kit or design system
- [ ] Add device targets: Specific breakpoints to support
- [ ] Add animation specs: Timing, easing, triggers

**Example:**
```
Create onboarding flow prototype:
Visual: Modern, minimal like Linear.app
Screens: Welcome → Features → Setup → Success
Interactions: Slide transitions, progress bar, hover states
Components: Cards with glassmorphism, animated icons
Mobile: Stack cards vertically, larger touch targets
```

#### Lovable Website Pattern
**Purpose:** Marketing sites, landing pages, portfolios

```
Build [type] website with:
Pages: [list all pages]
SEO: [keywords and meta description]
Performance: Target 95+ PageSpeed
Integrations: [Stripe/Analytics/Forms]
CTA: [primary conversion goal]
Mobile-first responsive design

Tech: React + Vite + Tailwind
Hosting: Vercel/Netlify ready
```

**Enhancement Options:**
- [ ] Add content strategy: Headlines, copy points
- [ ] Add conversion funnel: User journey to CTA
- [ ] Add A/B test variants: What to test
- [ ] Add analytics events: What to track
- [ ] Add performance budget: Size/speed limits

**Example:**
```
Build SaaS landing page:
Pages: Home, Features, Pricing, Contact
SEO: "project management software" focus
Hero: Video background, email capture
Features: 3-column grid with animations
Pricing: Toggle monthly/annual, highlight popular
Integrations: Stripe checkout, Intercom chat
Performance: <2s load, 95+ PageSpeed
```

#### Lovable App Pattern
**Purpose:** SaaS platforms, dashboards, tools

```
Develop [app type] application:
Tech: React + Supabase + Tailwind
Auth: [strategy - email/OAuth]
Features: [core functionality list]
Database: [main entities and relationships]
Start with: [initial component/feature]
Knowledge Base: [PRD context if needed]

Implementation phases:
1. Foundation (auth, routing)
2. Core features
3. Integrations
4. Polish
```

**Enhancement Options:**
- [ ] Add database schema: Complete SQL definitions
- [ ] Add API design: Endpoint specifications
- [ ] Add state management: Zustand/Context approach
- [ ] Add real-time features: Subscriptions needed
- [ ] Add deployment strategy: CI/CD pipeline

**Example:**
```
Develop team task manager:
Tech: React + Supabase + Tailwind + ShadCN
Auth: Email/password + Google OAuth
Features: Projects, tasks, comments, file uploads
Database:
- projects (id, name, owner_id)
- tasks (id, project_id, title, assignee_id, status)
- comments (id, task_id, user_id, content)
Start with: Project dashboard with task list
Real-time: Task updates, new comments
Phases:
1. Auth and project CRUD
2. Task management with drag-drop
3. Comments and notifications
4. File uploads and search
```

#### Chat vs Default Mode Strategy (Lovable-specific)
```
Use Chat Mode for:
- Planning architecture
- Debugging errors
- Design decisions
- Understanding Lovable features

Use Default Mode for:
- Building components
- Implementing features
- Styling updates
- Testing functionality

Example workflow:
Chat: "Plan the user authentication flow"
Default: "Implement login component with validation"
Chat: "Debug this Supabase RLS error"
Default: "Add password reset functionality"
```
