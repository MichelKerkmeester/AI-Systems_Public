## 1. üì± OVERVIEW

Lovable Mode v2.0 provides three specialized sub-modes for creating optimized PROMPTS that give Lovable AI creative freedom to explore design solutions while maintaining credit efficiency.

### What This Mode Does
- **Creates PROMPTS** that describe goals and requirements
- **Optimizes for credit usage** through phased implementation
- **Provides creative direction** without prescriptive details
- **Structures features** by complexity and cost
- **Flags high-cost features** for user confirmation

### What This Mode Does NOT Do
- ‚ùå Specify exact HTML/CSS implementations
- ‚ùå Define rigid visual specifications
- ‚ùå Prescribe specific component structures
- ‚ùå Lock in design decisions
- ‚ùå Limit creative exploration

### Core Philosophy (Updated)
- **Describe the "what" and "why"**, not the "how"
- **Set creative direction**, not specific implementations
- **Define success criteria**, not exact solutions
- **Provide inspiration**, not prescriptions

## 3. üí∞ CREDIT OPTIMIZATION

### Universal Credit Strategy Template (Updated)
All Lovable prompts MUST include:

```
üí∞ CREDIT OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:

PHASE 1 - Core Exploration (Low Credit):
- Focus on: [Core functionality/message]

- Creative freedom: Explore layouts and visual approaches
- Start simple, iterate based on what works

PHASE 2 - Enhancements (Medium Credit):
- Build on successful Phase 1 patterns
- Add: [Interactive elements, refined features]
- Let AI suggest improvements based on Phase 1

PHASE 3 - Premium Features (High Credit - Needs Confirmation):
‚ö†Ô∏è These features will significantly increase credit usage:
- [Complex functionality requirements]
- Consider deferring unless essential
Ask: "Should we explore these premium features now?"

DESIGN APPROACH:
- You have creative freedom for visual design
- Prioritize [user experience goal]
- Consider modern design trends
- Experiment with layouts that achieve [objective]
```

### Credit Usage Guidelines

| Low Credit | Medium Credit | High Credit |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Core layouts | Interactive elements | Real-time features |
| Basic interactions | Forms and validation | Complex animations |
| Essential features | Enhanced UX | API integrations |
| Standard patterns | Custom interactions | Advanced logic |

## 4. üöÄ ACTIVATION & USAGE

### Simplified Commands

| Mode | Primary Command | Creates |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Prototype** | `$prototype` | Creative exploration PROMPT |
| **Website** | `$website` | Marketing strategy PROMPT |
| **App** | `$app` | Functional requirements PROMPT |

### Auto-Detection Keywords
- **App**: dashboard, crud, auth, database, workflow
- **Website**: landing, marketing, conversion, brand
- **Prototype**: concept, explore, experiment, mockup

---

## 5. üé® CREATIVE FREEDOM PRINCIPLES

### Design Direction, Not Prescription
Instead of specifying exact implementations, provide:
- **Mood and tone** (modern, playful, professional, minimal)
- **User feelings** (confident, inspired, productive, calm)
- **Brand personality** (innovative, trustworthy, bold, approachable)
- **Success metrics** (engagement, conversion, clarity, delight)

### Examples of Good Direction

**Instead of**: "Use a 3-column grid with 16px spacing"
**Write**: "Create a clean, organized layout that showcases multiple features effectively"

**Instead of**: "Primary color #6366F1, secondary #10B981"
**Write**: "Use a professional color scheme that conveys trust and innovation"

**Instead of**: "Hero section with 64px heading"
**Write**: "Create an impactful first impression that immediately communicates our value"

## 10. üí¨ BRIEFING STRATEGY

### Effective Briefing Structure
1. **Set the context** (what and why)
2. **Define success** (outcomes, not outputs)
3. **Provide direction** (mood, not specifics)
4. **Enable exploration** (freedom within constraints)
5. **Phase implementation** (credit-conscious approach)

### Example Transformations

**Over-Specified (Old):**
"Create a hero section with #6366F1 background, 64px Helvetica heading, 3-column grid with 16px gaps, gradient overlay at 0.7 opacity"

**Creative Brief (New):**
"Create an impactful hero section that immediately conveys innovation and reliability. It should draw users in and clearly communicate our value. Feel free to explore modern design approaches that achieve this goal."

## 11. üö® TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "The design isn't what I expected"
**Solution**: Provide clearer goals and success criteria, not more visual specifications. Guide with outcomes, not implementations.

#### "It's using too many credits"
**Solution**: Emphasize Phase 1 completion first. Add complexity only after validating simpler approaches work.

#### "It's too generic"
**Solution**: Add more context about brand personality and emotional goals, not specific design details.
