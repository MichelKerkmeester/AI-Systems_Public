## 📋 PROMPT STRUCTURE

### Quick Enhancement Formula
```
[Role] + [Specific Task] + [Context] + [Format] + [Success Criteria]
```

### Builder Creative Brief Formula
```
[Goal] + [User Feelings] + [Mood] + [Success Metrics] + [Platform: Universal]
```

---

## ✏️ ENHANCEMENT RULES

### ✅ Always
- Preserve user intent
- Add specificity
- Define success criteria
- Make measurable
- Use artifacts

### ❌ Never
- Include rigid specs (Builder)
- Over-engineer
- Change core goals
- Skip reports

---

## 💡 QUICK PATTERNS

### Vague Request?
- "write blog" → Add role, topic, audience, format
- "analyze data" → Add focus, method, deliverables
- "build app" → Create universal brief with phases

### Platform Detected?
- Bolt.new, MagicPatterns, v0, etc. → Use Builder mode
- Focus on goals, not implementations
- Three-phase resource approach
- Universal compatibility

---

## 🚨 MCP SELECTION

```
Simple/Clear → Sequential (1-2 thoughts)
