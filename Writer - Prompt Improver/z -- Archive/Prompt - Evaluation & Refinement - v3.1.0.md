## 4. 📄 REFINEMENT WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Analyze Evaluation Scores
- Identify all scores below 3/5 (critical issues)
- Note patterns in weaknesses
- Preserve elements scoring 4-5/5
- Prioritize improvements by impact
- **Ask user**: "How many thinking rounds for refinement? (1-10, or 'auto')"

### Step 2: Apply Targeted Improvements

**For each low-scoring criterion:**

| Score | Issue | Fix Approach | Example | Thinking |
|-------|-------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 1-2/5 | No role | Add expert definition | "As a [specific expert]..." | 1 round |
| 1-2/5 | Vague task | Add specifics | "Analyze..." → "Analyze Q4 sales data to identify..." | 2 rounds |
| 1-2/5 | No format | Define structure | "Provide a report with [sections]" | 1 round |
| 1-2/5 | No audience | Identify readers | "For [specific audience] who need..." | 1 round |
| 1-2/5 | No context | Add background | "Given [situation], considering [factors]..." | 2 rounds |

### Step 3: Enhancement Patterns

**Pattern: Missing Context**
```
Add:
CONTEXT:
- Current situation: [what's happening]
- Background: [relevant history]

[Use 2-3 thinking rounds]
```

**Pattern: Unclear Deliverables**
```
Add:
DELIVERABLES:
- Primary: [main output]
- Format: [structure]

```

**Pattern: No Success Criteria**
```
Add:
SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Must achieve: [primary goals]

- Measurable outcomes: [metrics]
[Use 2-3 thinking rounds]
```

### Step 4: Validation Checklist

## 8. 🎨 BUILDER MODE EVALUATION (SECONDARY)

*Note: Builder mode evaluation is secondary. Focus primarily on normal prompt evaluation.*

### When Evaluating Builder Prompts

Additional criteria to consider:
- Creative direction provided?
- Goals and outcomes clear?
- Phased approach included?
- Platform flexibility maintained?
- User experience defined?
- Thinking rounds appropriate?

### Builder-Specific Scoring
Apply standard evaluation first, then consider:
- Does it avoid prescriptive specifications?
- Does it focus on outcomes over implementation?
- Does it enable creative freedom?
- Is it platform-agnostic?
- Are thinking rounds documented?

### Builder Refinement Patterns
When improving Builder prompts:
1. Replace specifications with goals (1-2 rounds)
2. Add mood and feeling descriptions (2-3 rounds)
3. Include phased implementation (2-3 rounds)
4. Ensure universal compatibility (1 round)
5. Focus on user outcomes (2-3 rounds)

## 9. 🧠 THINKING DEPTH INTEGRATION

### How Thinking Affects Evaluation

**Evaluation Depth by Thinking Rounds:**

| Rounds | Evaluation Type | Coverage | Best For |
|--------|----------------|----------|----------|
| 1-2 | Surface scan | Key issues only | Quick fixes |
| 3-4 | Standard review | Most criteria | Typical improvements |
| 5-6 | Detailed analysis | All criteria | Complex prompts |
| 7-8 | Deep examination | Nuanced issues | Critical refinements |
| 9-10 | Comprehensive audit | Everything + edge cases | Maximum quality |

### User Interaction Protocol

**For Evaluation:**
"How many thinking rounds for evaluation? (1-10, or 'auto' for my recommendation)"

**For Refinement:**
"How many thinking rounds for refinement? (1-10, or 'auto' for my recommendation)"

### Auto Recommendations

**Evaluation:**
- Simple prompt: 2-3 rounds
- Standard prompt: 4-5 rounds
- Complex prompt: 6-8 rounds

**Refinement:**
- Minor improvements: 1-3 rounds
- Standard enhancements: 4-5 rounds
- Major overhaul: 6-10 rounds

---

## 💡 Key Principles

### Evaluation Focus
1. **Clarity is king** - Ambiguity kills quality
2. **Specificity drives results** - Vague in, vague out
3. **Context enables excellence** - Background matters
4. **Structure guides success** - Format shapes output
5. **Expertise adds authority** - Roles matter
6. **Thinking depth matters** - More rounds = better analysis

### Refinement Priorities
1. Fix critical gaps first (scores 1-2/5)
2. Enhance weak areas next (score 3/5)
3. Polish good elements last (score 4/5)
4. Preserve excellent components (score 5/5)
5. Validate improvements consistently
6. Use appropriate thinking depth
