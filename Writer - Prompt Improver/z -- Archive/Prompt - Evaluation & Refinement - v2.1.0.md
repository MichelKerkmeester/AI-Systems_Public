# Evaluation & Refinement - v2.1.0

**Systematic quality assessment and improvement workflows** for optimizing prompts through structured evaluation and targeted refinement, with credit optimization and visual matching support.

**Note:** The Full Mode (`$refine`) automatically applies this evaluation and refinement framework in a three-phase process. Use manual evaluation/refinement when you need more control or want to skip phases.

## 6. üìä SCORING GUIDE

**5/5 - Excellent:** Clear, specific, with examples, phases, and credit optimization
**4/5 - Good:** Clear and specific, minor improvements possible
**3/5 - Adequate:** Functional but lacks precision or credit strategy
**2/5 - Weak:** Vague or ambiguous, missing credit optimization
**1/5 - Poor:** Unclear, contradictory, or missing entirely

**Lovable-Specific Calibration:**
- **5/5:** Complete PROMPT with phased implementation and visual matching
- **4/5:** Good PROMPT with minor credit optimization gaps
- **3/5:** Basic PROMPT without credit strategy
- **2/5:** Generic prompt not optimized for Lovable
- **1/5:** Missing critical Lovable requirements

**Credit Optimization Calibration:**
- **5/5:** Clear 3-phase approach with cost warnings
- **4/5:** Phases defined, some warnings missing
- **3/5:** Basic separation of features
- **2/5:** Minimal credit consideration
- **1/5:** No credit optimization

## 7. üîÑ REFINEMENT WORKFLOW

**Note:** This workflow is automated in Full Mode (`$refine`). Use manual refinement for targeted improvements.

### 7.1 Step 1: Analyze Evaluation
- Identify scores below 3/5 (critical issues)
- Check for missing credit optimization
- Verify visual reference extraction
- Note patterns in weaknesses
- Preserve elements scoring 4-5/5

### 7.2 Step 2: Apply Targeted Fixes

**For each low-scoring criterion:**

| Issue | Quick Fix | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Unclear task (1-2/5) | Add action verb + deliverable | "build..." ‚Üí "Create PROMPT for building..." |
| Missing role (1-2/5) | Add expertise definition | Add: "As a [role]..." |
| No format (1-2/5) | Specify structure | Add: "Format: [structure]" |
| No credit strategy | Add phased approach | Add: "Phase 1 (Low): [features]" |
| No visual match | Extract from reference | Add: "Match [screenshot] with colors: [hex]" |
| Missing "PROMPT" note | Clarify output | Add: "Note: This is a PROMPT for..." |

### 7.3 Step 3: Enhancement Patterns

**Pattern: Missing Credit Optimization**
```
Add:
PHASE 1 - Core (Low Credit):
- Essential features only
- Basic structure
- Simple styling

PHASE 2 - Enhancement (Medium Credit):
- Nice-to-have features
- Interactions
- Forms

PHASE 3 - Premium (High Credit - Confirm):
‚ö†Ô∏è Complex features - implement now?
- Real-time
- Integrations
- Advanced animations
```

**Pattern: Missing Visual Reference Extraction**
```
Add:
VISUAL REFERENCE:
- Colors: #[hex1], #[hex2]
- Layout: [grid/flex structure]
- Components: [buttons, cards, forms]
- Spacing: [8px/16px system]
- Typography: [fonts and sizes]
```

### 7.4 Step 4: Validation
- ‚úÖ Re-score against failed criteria
- ‚úÖ Verify credit optimization included
- ‚úÖ Check visual reference matched
- ‚úÖ Ensure "PROMPT not implementation" clear
- ‚úÖ Validate phased approach present

## 8. üìù REFINEMENT EXAMPLES

### 8.1 Example: Adding Credit Optimization
**Before (2/5):** "Build a todo app with React and Supabase"
**After (5/5):** 
```
Create a PROMPT for developing a todo app:

üí∞ CREDIT OPTIMIZATION:
Phase 1 (Low): Basic CRUD, simple auth
Phase 2 (Medium): Categories, due dates
Phase 3 (High - Confirm): Real-time sync, notifications

Tech: React + Supabase + Tailwind
Start with: Dashboard component

Note: This is a PROMPT for developing an app, not the app itself
```

### 8.2 Example: Visual Reference Enhancement
**Before (2/5):** "Make this design [screenshot]"
**After (5/5):**
```
Create a PROMPT for building this interface:

VISUAL REFERENCE MATCHED:
- Colors: #6366F1 (primary), #F3F4F6 (background)
- Layout: 3-column grid with sidebar
- Components: Card-based with shadows
- Spacing: 16px grid system
- Typography: Inter headings, system body

üí∞ Phase 1: Static layout matching screenshot
Phase 2: Add interactions
Phase 3: Complex animations (confirm first)

Note: This is a PROMPT for implementation
```

### 8.3 Example: Lovable App Enhancement
**Before (2/5):** "Create project management tool"
**After (5/5):**
```
Create a PROMPT for developing a project management app:

üí∞ CREDIT OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:

PHASE 1 - MVP Core (Low Credit):
- Project CRUD operations
- Basic task management
- Simple email/password auth
- Static Kanban board view

PHASE 2 - Enhanced Features (Medium Credit):
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- User assignments
- Due dates and priorities
- Activity feed

PHASE 3 - Premium Features (High Credit - Needs Confirmation):
‚ö†Ô∏è The following will significantly increase credit usage:
- Real-time collaboration
- File uploads to Supabase Storage
- Email notifications
- Advanced permissions
Ask: "Should I implement these now or defer?"

Tech Stack: React + Supabase + Tailwind + ShadCN
Database Schema:
- projects (id, name, owner_id)
- tasks (id, project_id, title, status, assignee_id)
- comments (id, task_id, user_id, content)

Start with: Project dashboard with task list

REUSE STRATEGY:
- Use ShadCN components for UI
- Leverage Supabase Auth templates
- Copy Kanban patterns from examples
- Use Tailwind utilities exclusively

Note: This is a PROMPT for developing an app, not the actual application
```

## 9. üéØ COMMON REFINEMENT PATTERNS

### 9.1 The Credit-Unconscious Request
**Indicators:** Lovable request without phasing
**Fix:** Add 3-phase implementation with cost warnings
**Template:** 
```
Phase 1: [Essentials] - Low Credit
Phase 2: [Enhancements] - Medium Credit
Phase 3: [Complex] - High Credit (Confirm)
```

### 9.2 The Visual-Ignorant Request
**Indicators:** Screenshot provided but not referenced
**Fix:** Extract and specify visual details
**Template:**
```
Match provided [screenshot]:
- Colors: [extract hex codes]
- Layout: [identify structure]
- Components: [list elements]
```

### 9.3 The Implementation Confusion
**Indicators:** Seems to want actual build, not PROMPT
**Fix:** Clarify we create PROMPTS only
**Template:**
```
Create a PROMPT for [building/developing]:
[specifications]
Note: This creates a PROMPT, not the actual [app/website/prototype]
```

### 9.4 The Lovable Request
**Indicators:** Platform development without specifications
**Fix:** Add tech stack + features + phases + credit strategy
**Template:**
```
Create PROMPT for [type] with React + Supabase:
Phase 1: [MVP features] - Low Credit
Phase 2: [Enhancements] - Medium Credit
Phase 3: [Complex] - High Credit (Confirm)
Start with: [component]
```
