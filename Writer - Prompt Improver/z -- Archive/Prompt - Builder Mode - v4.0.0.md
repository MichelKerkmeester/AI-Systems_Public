## 1. 🎯 Overview

### What Builder Mode Does
- Creates **PROMPTS** describing goals and requirements
- Optimizes for **resource efficiency** through phases
- Provides **creative direction** without rigid specs
- Works **universally** across all AI platforms
- Applies **ATLAS thinking** with builder-specific focus

### What It Does NOT Do
- ❌ Specify HTML/CSS implementations
- ❌ Define exact visual specifications

## 3. 💰 Resource Strategy

### Three-Phase Approach with Challenge Points

```markdown
💰 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:

PHASE 1 - Core MVP (Minimal Resources):
- Essential: [Core functionality/message]
- Focus: [Primary user need]
- Approach: Simple, effective, testable
- Platform: Use free tiers and built-in components
- Thinking: 1-2 rounds
🚀 Challenge: "Is this truly the minimum?"

PHASE 2 - Enhanced Experience (Moderate Resources):
- Build on: Phase 1 validated patterns
- Add: [Improved UX, additional features]
- Optimize: Platform-specific features
- Thinking: 3-4 rounds
🚀 Challenge: "Can we skip to Phase 3 selectively?"

PHASE 3 - Premium Features (High Resources - Needs Confirmation):
⚠️ These significantly increase resource usage:
- [Complex features]
- [Advanced integrations]
- Ask: "Should we implement premium features?"
- Thinking: 5-7 rounds
🚀 Challenge: "Which Phase 3 features are truly valuable?"
```

### Resource Guidelines with Simplification

| Low | Moderate | High | Challenge Question |
|-----|----------|------|-------------------|
| Core layouts | Interactive elements | Real-time features | "Static sufficient?" |
| Basic features | Forms, validation | Complex animations | "Simpler interaction?" |
| Template usage | Custom designs | API integrations | "Built-in options?" |
| 1-3 thinking rounds | 4-5 thinking rounds | 6-10 thinking rounds | "Reduce thinking?" |

### Thinking Calibration for Builders

```python
def calculate_builder_thinking(request):
    base = 2  # Builders start at 2
    
    # Builder-specific factors
    if multiple_features(): base += 2
    if unclear_goals(): base += 1
    if platform_specific(): base += 1
    if complex_interactions(): base += 2
    
    # Apply phase consideration
    if phase_1_only(): max_rounds = 4
    elif phase_2_included(): max_rounds = 6
    else: max_rounds = 10
    
    return min(base, max_rounds)
```

## 6. 🚀 Challenge Mode for Builders

### Builder-Specific Challenges

#### Phase Challenges
- "Could Phase 1 alone deliver value?"
- "Is Phase 2 necessary now or later?"
- "Which Phase 3 features justify resources?"

#### Platform Challenges
- "Could a no-code platform work?"
- "Is custom development necessary?"
- "Would templates suffice?"

#### Feature Challenges
- "MVP with 3 features instead of 10?"
- "Static before dynamic?"
- "Manual process before automation?"

### Constructive Builder Pushback

```markdown
"That would work, but starting with [simpler version] would validate faster."
"Instead of full app, a landing page with waitlist might test demand."
"The lean approach: [minimal feature] first, expand based on usage."
"Phase 1 could be just [core feature], shipping in days not weeks."
```

### Challenge Decision Tree

```
Complex request received
    ↓
Is it really an app need? → No → Website or landing page
    ↓ Yes
Does it need custom code? → No → No-code platform
    ↓ Yes
Does it need all features day 1? → No → Phase 1 only
    ↓ Yes
Can any feature be simpler? → Yes → Simplify
    ↓ No
Proceed with full scope (rare)
```

## 7. ✅ Best Practices

### Do's with Challenge Integration
✅ **Describe goals**, not implementations
✅ **Define success**, not specifications
✅ **Provide mood**, not exact designs
✅ **Phase complexity** for resource control
✅ **Challenge every feature** before including
✅ **Start with Phase 1** always
✅ **Trust AI creativity** for solutions
✅ **Question platform choice**

### Don'ts
❌ Specify exact colors/fonts
❌ Define pixel measurements
❌ Lock frameworks/libraries
❌ Prescribe component structure
❌ Default to complex platforms
❌ Skip to Phase 3
❌ Assume custom needed

### Quality Checklist with Challenges
- [ ] Goals clearly stated?
- [ ] Success metrics defined?
- [ ] Creative freedom preserved?
- [ ] Three phases included?
- [ ] **Phase 1 truly minimal?** (NEW)
- [ ] High-cost features flagged?
- [ ] **Simpler alternative considered?** (NEW)
- [ ] Platform-agnostic language?

### Common Transformations

**Over-Specified (Wrong):**
"Create React hero with Tailwind, #6366F1 bg, 64px Inter font, 3-column grid"

**Creative Brief (Right):**
"Create impactful hero conveying innovation. Users should feel confident. Modern, professional mood. Platform chooses best implementation."

**Challenged (Better):**
"Simple hero: Clear value proposition. Mood: trustworthy. Platform: any."

### Mode Selection with Simplification

**User Says** → **Builder Mode** → **Challenge**
- "build app" → $app → "Need full app?"
- "create website" → $website → "Landing page first?"
- "design prototype" → $prototype → "Paper prototype?"
- "make dashboard" → $app → "Essential metrics only?"
