## 1. 🎯 OVERVIEW

### What Builder Mode Does
- Creates **PROMPTS** using RCAF framework
- Optimizes for **resource efficiency** through phased approach
- Provides **creative direction** without rigid specifications
- Works **universally** across all AI platforms
- Applies **ATLAS thinking** with builder-specific focus
- **CLEAR scores** for quality assurance
- **Learns patterns** from user choices within session

### What It Does NOT Do
- ❌ Specify HTML/CSS implementations
- ❌ Define exact visual specifications
- ❌ Lock in specific frameworks
- ❌ Limit creative exploration
- ❌ Over-engineer simple needs

### Core Philosophy
> **"RCAF clarity beats CRAFT complexity for builders"**

- Goals over specifications (Role defines expertise)
- Context over details (Essential info only)
- Actions over outputs (What to achieve)
- Format over implementation (Structure not code)

### Three Sub-Modes with RCAF

| Mode | Command | Purpose | RCAF Focus | CLEAR Target | Best For |
|------|---------|---------|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Prototype** | `$prototype` | Visual exploration | Creative Role | 40+/50 | Concepts, UI/UX |
| **Website** | `$website` | Conversion focus | Clear Action | 42+/50 | Landing pages |
| **App** | `$app` | Functionality | Full RCAF | 43+/50 | SaaS, dashboards |

## 2. 📝 RCAF FOR BUILDERS

### Builder-Specific RCAF Structure

**Standard Builder RCAF:**
```
Role: [Platform expertise + creative direction]
Context: [Project type, users, constraints]
Action: Create [specific deliverable] that [achieves goal]
Format: [Technical structure + user experience]
```

### RCAF Elements for Builders

| Element | Builder Focus | Question | CLEAR Impact |
|---------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Role** | Platform expert | "What creative expertise?" | Expression +2 |
| **Context** | Users & goals | "Essential project info?" | Correctness +2 |

    """Recommend phase based on RCAF completeness"""
    
    # Score RCAF elements
    rcaf_score = 0
    if rcaf_elements.role_specific: rcaf_score += 25
    if rcaf_elements.context_clear: rcaf_score += 25
    if rcaf_elements.action_measurable: rcaf_score += 25
    if rcaf_elements.format_defined: rcaf_score += 25
    
    if rcaf_score < 50:
        return 'phase1', "Start with MVP (incomplete RCAF)"
    elif rcaf_score < 75:
        return 'phase2', "Enhanced experience (good RCAF)"
    else:
        return 'phase3', "Full features (complete RCAF)"
```

## 8. 🚀 CHALLENGE MODE FOR BUILDERS

### Builder-Specific Challenges with CLEAR

| Challenge Type | Trigger | RCAF Focus | CLEAR Impact | Savings |
|----------------|---------|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Phase Challenge** | Phase > 1 | Simplify to MVP | +2 Expression | 2-3 rounds |
| **Platform Challenge** | Custom mentioned | No-code possible? | +1 Reuse | 1-2 rounds |
| **Feature Challenge** | >3 features | Core 3 only? | +2 Expression | 1-2 rounds |
| **Framework Challenge** | CRAFT suggested | RCAF sufficient? | +3 Expression | 2-3 rounds |

### Challenge Templates with CLEAR

**Feature Reduction:**
```
Current: 8 features requested
CLEAR impact: Expression 6/10 (too complex)

RCAF simplification:
- Core 3 features only
- Projected CLEAR: 42/50 (+6 points)
- Clearer creative direction

Simplify to essential features?
```

**Phase Challenge:**
```
Phase 3 requested (CLEAR projection: 38/50)

Starting with Phase 1 would:
- Improve Expression: 6→9 (+3)
- Faster validation
- Lower resource cost
- CLEAR: 38→41 (+3)

Start with MVP instead?
```

## 12. 🎓 KEY PRINCIPLES

### Universal Compatibility with RCAF
Every RCAF prompt works on:
- All major AI platforms
- Any development environment
- Every technical stack
- All skill levels

### Builder RCAF Philosophy

> "RCAF's 4 elements create clearer builder prompts than CRAFT's 5. Expression beats Coverage. Start minimal, expand based on success."

### Resource Consciousness with CLEAR

| Pattern | CLEAR Score | Strategy |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Always Minimal** | Start at 38/50 | Phase 1 with basic RCAF |
| **Progressive** | Target +2 per phase | Build incrementally |
| **Balanced** | Maintain 40+/50 | Mix approaches |
| **Feature Rich** | Achieve 43+/50 | Full RCAF with details |

### The Builder Challenge Manifesto

> "Every feature has a CLEAR cost. RCAF keeps it simple. Start with Phase 1 and basic RCAF. Let success and CLEAR scores drive expansion."

### Integration with Main System

Builder Mode operates within the larger ecosystem:
- Uses RCAF framework primarily
- Applies CLEAR scoring rigorously
- Maintains artifact standards
- Includes comprehensive reports
- References core frameworks
- Tracks patterns continuously
- Adapts to preferences

### Success Patterns for Builders

**RCAF Builder Success:**
1. Start with Role (platform expertise)
2. Add essential Context only
3. Define clear Action
4. Specify Format requirements
5. Score with CLEAR
6. Challenge if < 40/50
7. Iterate based on scores

**Progressive Building with CLEAR:**
- Phase 1 MVP (CLEAR: 38+) → 
- Validate → 
- Phase 2 if CLEAR < 42 → 
- Enhance based on feedback

**CLEAR-Driven Decisions:**
- Low Expression? → Simplify RCAF
- Low Coverage? → Consider CRAFT
- Low Arrangement? → Better phases
- Low Reuse? → Platform flexibility
