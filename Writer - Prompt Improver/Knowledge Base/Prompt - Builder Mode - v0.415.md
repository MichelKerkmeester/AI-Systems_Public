## 1. üéØ OVERVIEW

### What Builder Mode Does
- Creates **PROMPTS** using RCAF framework
- Optimizes for **resource efficiency** through phased approach
- Provides **creative direction** without rigid specifications
- Works **universally** across all AI platforms
- Applies **ATLAS thinking** with builder-specific focus
- **CLEAR scores** for quality assurance
- **Learns patterns** from user choices within session
- **Multi-format support** for different deployment needs

### What It Does NOT Do
- ‚ùå Specify HTML/CSS implementations
- ‚ùå Define exact visual specifications
- ‚ùå Lock in specific frameworks
- ‚ùå Limit creative exploration
- ‚ùå Over-engineer simple needs

### Core Philosophy
> **"RCAF clarity beats CRAFT complexity for builders"**

- Goals over specifications (Role defines expertise)
- Context over details (Essential info only)
- Actions over outputs (What to achieve)
- Format over implementation (Structure not code)

### Three Sub-Modes with RCAF

| Mode | Command | Purpose | RCAF Focus | CLEAR Target | Best For | Default Format |
|------|---------|---------|------------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **Prototype** | `$prototype` | Visual exploration | Creative Role | 40+/50 | Concepts, UI/UX | Standard/YAML |
| **Website** | `$website` | Conversion focus | Clear Action | 42+/50 | Landing pages | Standard/YAML |
| **App** | `$app` | Functionality | Full RCAF | 43+/50 | SaaS, dashboards | YAML/JSON |

## 5. üí∞ RESOURCE STRATEGY

### Three-Phase Approach with CLEAR and Format

| Phase | Name | Resource | RCAF Depth | CLEAR Target | Features | Best Format |
|-------|------|----------|------------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Core MVP | Minimal | Basic RCAF | 38+/50 | Essential only | Standard |
| **Phase 2** | Enhanced | Moderate | Full RCAF | 40+/50 | Improved UX | YAML |
| **Phase 3** | Premium | High | RCAF+ | 42+/50 | Advanced | YAML/JSON |

### Phase Recommendation with RCAF and Format

```python
def recommend_phase_with_rcaf(rcaf_elements, session_context=None):
    """Recommend phase and format based on RCAF completeness"""
    
    # Score RCAF elements
    rcaf_score = 0
    if rcaf_elements.role_specific: rcaf_score += 25
    if rcaf_elements.context_clear: rcaf_score += 25
    if rcaf_elements.action_measurable: rcaf_score += 25
    if rcaf_elements.format_defined: rcaf_score += 25
    
    # Check session patterns if available
    session_note = ""
    if session_context and session_context.phase_history:
        typical_phase = max(set(session_context.phase_history), 
                          key=session_context.phase_history.count)
        session_note = f" (You typically start with Phase {typical_phase})"
    
    if rcaf_score < 50:
        return 'phase1', 'standard', f"Start with MVP (incomplete RCAF){session_note}"
    elif rcaf_score < 75:
        return 'phase2', 'yaml', f"Enhanced experience (good RCAF){session_note}"
    else:
        return 'phase3', 'yaml', f"Full features (complete RCAF){session_note}"
```

### Resource Guidelines with CLEAR and Format

| Resource Level | RCAF Elements | CLEAR Score | Components | Format | Session Note |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|------------|--------|--------------|
| **Low** | Role + Action | 35-39/50 | Basic | Standard | Session-aware |
| **Moderate** | Full RCAF | 40-42/50 | Custom | YAML | Suggested |

## 7. üöÄ CHALLENGE MODE FOR BUILDERS

### Builder-Specific Challenges with CLEAR and Format

| Challenge Type | Trigger | RCAF Focus | CLEAR Impact | Format Impact | Savings |
|----------------|---------|------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| **Phase Challenge** | Phase > 1 | Simplify to MVP | +2 Expression | Standard simpler | 2-3 rounds |
| **Platform Challenge** | Custom mentioned | No-code possible? | +1 Reuse | YAML templates | 1-2 rounds |
| **Feature Challenge** | >3 features | Core 3 only? | +2 Expression | Standard clearer | 1-2 rounds |
| **Framework Challenge** | CRAFT suggested | RCAF sufficient? | +3 Expression | Standard optimal | 2-3 rounds |
| **Format Challenge** | Complex format | Simpler format? | +1 Expression | Standard vs structured | 1-2 rounds |

### Challenge Templates with CLEAR and Format

**Feature Reduction:**
```
Current: 8 features requested
CLEAR impact: Expression 6/10 (too complex)
Format impact: Would need complex YAML/JSON

RCAF simplification:
- Core 3 features only
- Standard format sufficient
- Projected CLEAR: 42/50 (+6 points)
- Clearer creative direction

Simplify to essential features?
```

**Format Challenge:**
```
Complex JSON structure requested (Token overhead: +10%)

Simpler alternatives:
- YAML: +5% tokens, more readable
- Standard: Baseline, maximum clarity

CLEAR impact:
- JSON: Expression 7/10
- YAML: Expression 8/10
- Standard: Expression 9/10

Prioritize clarity with simpler format?
```

## 11. üéì KEY PRINCIPLES

### Universal Compatibility with RCAF and Format
Every RCAF prompt works on:
- All major AI platforms
- Any development environment
- Every technical stack
- All skill levels
- Multiple output formats

### Builder RCAF Philosophy

> "RCAF's 4 elements create clearer builder prompts than CRAFT's 5. Expression beats Coverage. Start minimal, expand based on success."

### Format Philosophy for Builders

> "Standard for clarity. YAML for templates. JSON for APIs."

**Builder Format Decision Tree:**
```
IF prototype ‚Üí Standard (speed)
IF reusable template ‚Üí YAML (editability)  
IF API integration ‚Üí JSON (structure)
IF unclear ‚Üí Standard (default)
```

### Artifact Philosophy

> "Minimal header at top: Mode, Complexity, Framework, CLEAR. Enhanced content follows. Nothing else. Zero distraction, maximum clarity."

### Resource Consciousness with CLEAR and Format

| Pattern | CLEAR Score | Strategy | Format |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Always Minimal** | Start at 38/50 | Phase 1 with basic RCAF | Standard |
| **Progressive** | Target +2 per phase | Build incrementally | Standard ‚Üí YAML |
| **Balanced** | Maintain 40+/50 | Mix approaches | YAML |
| **Feature Rich** | Achieve 43+/50 | Full RCAF with details | YAML/JSON |

### The Builder Challenge Manifesto

> "Every feature has a CLEAR cost. Every format has token overhead. RCAF keeps it simple. Start with Phase 1 and Standard format. Let success and CLEAR scores drive expansion. Deliver with minimal header only."

### Integration with Main System

Builder Mode operates within the larger ecosystem:
- Uses RCAF framework primarily
- Applies CLEAR scoring rigorously
- Supports all formats (Standard/YAML/JSON)
- Maintains artifact standards (minimal header)
- References core frameworks
- Tracks session patterns continuously
- Adapts to session preferences

### Success Patterns for Builders

**RCAF Builder Success:**
1. Start with Role (platform expertise)
2. Add essential Context only
3. Define clear Action
4. Specify Format requirements
5. Score with CLEAR
6. Challenge if < 40/50
7. Select optimal format
8. Iterate based on scores
9. Deliver with minimal header

**Progressive Building with CLEAR:**
- Phase 1 MVP (CLEAR: 38+, Standard) ‚Üí 
- Validate ‚Üí 
- Phase 2 if CLEAR < 42 (YAML) ‚Üí 
- Enhance based on feedback

**CLEAR-Driven Decisions:**
- Low Expression? ‚Üí Simplify RCAF, use Standard
- Low Coverage? ‚Üí Consider CRAFT (rare)
- Low Arrangement? ‚Üí Better phases, use YAML
- Low Reuse? ‚Üí Platform flexibility, YAML templates

**Format Selection for Builders:**
- Prototypes: Standard (60%), YAML (30%), JSON (10%)
- Websites: Standard (40%), YAML (45%), JSON (15%)
- Apps: Standard (20%), YAML (60%), JSON (20%)

---

*Builder Mode with RCAF structure, CLEAR scoring, and multi-format support: Universal creative briefs that enable ANY AI platform to excel. RCAF provides clarity, CLEAR ensures quality, formats provide flexibility, minimal header eliminates distraction. Every builder prompt scored, every phase justified, every session pattern learned, every format considered. Start minimal with Phase 1 and Standard format, expand to YAML for templates based on CLEAR scores and real validation. Deliver with single-line header for maximum focus.*
