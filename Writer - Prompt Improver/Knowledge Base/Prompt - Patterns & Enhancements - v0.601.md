    """
    Select between Standard, JSON, and SMILE formats
    See format guide for detailed selection criteria
    """
    
    # API or programmatic use
    if constraints.get('api_integration'):
        return 'json'
    
    # Complex multi-step workflows
    elif complexity > 7:
        return 'smile'
    
    # Default to standard for most cases

## 13. 🎓 KEY PRINCIPLES & PHILOSOPHY

### Pattern Selection Principles

```
        ┌───────────────┐
        │     ToT       │ (Complex decisions, 7-10 complexity)
        ├───────────────┤
        │    ReAct      │ (Action-oriented, 5-8 complexity)
        ├───────────────┤
        │     CoT       │ (Reasoning tasks, 4-7 complexity)
        ├───────────────┤
        │   Standard    │ (Simple tasks, 1-4 complexity)
        └───────────────┘
```

### Core Guidelines

| Principle | Description | Priority |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Clarity First** | Ambiguity destroys effectiveness | 1.0 |
| **Right Pattern** | Match technique to task | 0.9 |
| **Simplicity** | Use minimum complexity needed | 0.8 |
| **Measurable** | Define success criteria | 0.7 |
| **Adaptive** | Learn from outcomes | 0.6 |

### The Ultimate Pattern Question

> "Does this pattern genuinely improve outcomes, or just add complexity?"

**Decision Framework:**
```python
def should_use_pattern(task, pattern):
    benefit = calculate_pattern_benefit(task, pattern)
    cost = calculate_complexity_cost(pattern)
    
    return benefit / cost > 1.5  # 50% more benefit than cost
```
