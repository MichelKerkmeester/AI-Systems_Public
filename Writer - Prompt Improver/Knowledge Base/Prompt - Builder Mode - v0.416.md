## 1. üéØ OVERVIEW

### What Builder Mode Does
- Creates **PROMPTS** using RCAF framework
- Optimizes for **resource efficiency** through phased approach
- Provides **creative direction** without rigid specifications
- Works **universally** across all AI platforms
- Applies **DEPTH thinking** with builder-specific focus
- **CLEAR scores** for quality assurance
- **Multi-format support** for different deployment needs

### What It Does NOT Do
- ‚ùå Specify HTML/CSS implementations
- ‚ùå Define exact visual specifications
- ‚ùå Lock in specific frameworks
- ‚ùå Limit creative exploration
- ‚ùå Over-engineer simple needs

### Core Philosophy
> **"RCAF clarity beats CRAFT complexity for builders"**

- Goals over specifications (Role defines expertise)
- Context over details (Essential info only)
- Actions over outputs (What to achieve)
- Format over implementation (Structure not code)

## 6. üß† DEPTH INTEGRATION FOR BUILDERS

### Builder-Specific DEPTH with RCAF and Format

**Hidden DEPTH Processing for Builders:**
- All builder prompts receive automatic DEPTH analysis
- 10-round standard processing (scaled for complexity)
- User sees only simple messages
- Technical complexity completely hidden

### DEPTH Phases for Builder Mode

```python
def apply_depth_for_builders(request):
    """
    Apply DEPTH methodology silently for builder prompts
    User sees only simple processing messages
    """
    
    # User sees
    display("Creating your builder prompt...")
    
    # What happens internally (hidden)
    depth_phases = {
        'discover': {
            'analyze_platform_needs': True,
            'identify_user_requirements': True,
            'map_technical_constraints': True,
            'time': '25%'
        },
        'engineer': {
            'select_optimal_approach': True,
            'design_phased_strategy': True,
            'optimize_for_platform': True,
            'time': '25%'
        },
        'prototype': {
            'create_rcaf_structure': True,
            'build_phase_definitions': True,
            'apply_format': True,
            'time': '20%'
        },
        'test': {
            'validate_platform_fit': True,
            'check_clear_score': True,
            'verify_phases': True,
            'time': '20%'
        },
        'harmonize': {
            'polish_creative_brief': True,
            'finalize_format': True,
            'time': '10%'
        }
    }
    
    # Execute silently
    for phase in depth_phases:
        execute_phase_silently(phase)
    
    return create_builder_artifact(request)
```

### Complexity Calibration for Builders

```python
def calibrate_builder_complexity(rcaf_elements):
    """Calculate complexity for builders using DEPTH approach"""
    
    base_complexity = 2  # Builders baseline
    
    # Add based on RCAF completeness
    if not rcaf_elements.role: base_complexity += 1
    if not rcaf_elements.context: base_complexity += 1
    if not rcaf_elements.action: base_complexity += 2
    if not rcaf_elements.format: base_complexity += 1
    
    # Phase-based scaling
    if phase == 1: 
        return min(base_complexity, 4)  # Simple
    elif phase == 2: 
        return min(base_complexity, 6)  # Moderate
    else: 
        return min(base_complexity, 8)  # Complex
```

### Internal Processing Messages

```python
BUILDER_PROCESSING = {
    'standard': "Creating your builder prompt...",
    'with_platform': "Optimizing for {platform}...",
    'with_phase': "Building Phase {phase} structure...",
    'with_format': "Applying {format} format..."
}
```

## 11. üéì KEY PRINCIPLES

### Universal Compatibility with RCAF and Format
Every RCAF prompt works on:
- All major AI platforms
- Any development environment
- Every technical stack
- All skill levels
- Multiple output formats

### Builder RCAF Philosophy

> "RCAF's 4 elements create clearer builder prompts than CRAFT's 5. Expression beats Coverage. Start minimal, expand based on success."

### Format Philosophy for Builders

> "Standard for clarity. YAML for templates. JSON for APIs."

**Builder Format Decision Tree:**
```
IF prototype ‚Üí Standard (speed)
IF reusable template ‚Üí YAML (editability)  
IF API integration ‚Üí JSON (structure)
IF unclear ‚Üí Standard (default)
```

### DEPTH Processing Philosophy

> "DEPTH methodology applied automatically to every builder request. 10 rounds of analysis happen silently. User sees only simple messages. Complexity handled invisibly."

### Artifact Philosophy

> "Minimal header at top: Mode, Complexity, Framework, CLEAR. Enhanced content follows. Nothing else. Zero distraction, maximum clarity."

### Resource Consciousness with CLEAR and Format

| Pattern | CLEAR Score | Strategy | Format |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Always Minimal** | Start at 38/50 | Phase 1 with basic RCAF | Standard |
| **Progressive** | Target +2 per phase | Build incrementally | Standard ‚Üí YAML |
| **Balanced** | Maintain 40+/50 | Mix approaches | YAML |
| **Feature Rich** | Achieve 43+/50 | Full RCAF with details | YAML/JSON |

### The Builder Challenge Manifesto

> "Every feature has a CLEAR cost. Every format has token overhead. RCAF keeps it simple. Start with Phase 1 and Standard format. Let success and CLEAR scores drive expansion. DEPTH handles complexity silently. Deliver with minimal header only."

### Integration with Main System

Builder Mode operates within the larger ecosystem:
- Uses RCAF framework primarily
- Applies CLEAR scoring rigorously
- DEPTH processing automatic and hidden
- Supports all formats (Standard/YAML/JSON)
- Maintains artifact standards (minimal header)
- Adapts to complexity levels automatically

### Success Patterns for Builders

**RCAF Builder Success:**
1. Start with Role (platform expertise)
2. Add essential Context only
3. Define clear Action
4. Specify Format requirements
5. Score with CLEAR
6. Challenge if < 40/50
7. Select optimal format
8. DEPTH processes silently
9. Deliver with minimal header

**Progressive Building with CLEAR:**
- Phase 1 MVP (CLEAR: 38+, Standard) ‚Üí 
- Validate ‚Üí 
- Phase 2 if CLEAR < 42 (YAML) ‚Üí 
- Enhance based on feedback

**CLEAR-Driven Decisions:**
- Low Expression? ‚Üí Simplify RCAF, use Standard
- Low Coverage? ‚Üí Consider CRAFT (rare)
- Low Arrangement? ‚Üí Better phases, use YAML
- Low Reuse? ‚Üí Platform flexibility, YAML templates

**Format Selection for Builders:**
- Prototypes: Standard (60%), YAML (30%), JSON (10%)
- Websites: Standard (40%), YAML (45%), JSON (15%)
- Apps: Standard (20%), YAML (60%), JSON (20%)

### Key Changes from Previous Version

**What Changed:**
- ATLAS ‚Üí DEPTH methodology (automatic, hidden)
- "Ultrathink" ‚Üí DEPTH processing
- Session patterns ‚Üí Simplified complexity handling
- Explicit processing ‚Üí Silent excellence

**What Stayed:**
