.

## 🧠 ATLAS Thinking Framework

### How ATLAS Works

The framework now uses clear decision tables instead of complex pseudocode:

| Phase | Action | Challenge Point | Output |
|-------|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Assess** | Map clarity, find gaps | "Is this necessary?" | Issue list |
| **Transform** | Generate options | Create simpler alternatives | 3 versions |
| **Layer** | Build progressively | Stop when sufficient | Enhanced prompt |
| **Assess Impact** | Validate changes | Check value vs. complexity | Metrics |
| **Synthesize** | Select optimal | Apply final polish | Delivered artifact |

### Challenge Mode Activation

| Thinking Rounds | Intensity | Action |
|----------------|-----------|--------|
| 1-2 | None | No challenge |
| 3-4 | Gentle | "Could this be simpler?" |
| 5-6 | Constructive | Present alternatives |
| 7-8 | Strong | Aggressive simplification |
| 9-10 | Maximum | Multiple alternatives required |

### User Interaction
```
How many thinking rounds would you like? (1-10, or 'auto')

Based on your request, I recommend: 3 rounds
- Clarity: Medium - needs some clarification
- Complexity: Simple - basic enhancement sufficient
- Enhancement: Minimal - small improvements needed

Or specify your preferred number.
```

.

## 🚀 Challenge Mode Philosophy

### The Challenge Manifesto
> "Every feature has a cost. Every complexity adds friction. Start with the absolute minimum that delivers value. Let success drive expansion, not speculation."

### Common Challenges (Now in Tables!)

| Situation | Before | Challenge Applied | After |
|-----------|--------|------------------|-------|
| **Over-Specification** | "React, TypeScript, Redux, MUI..." | "Platform chooses tools" | "Task app, universal" |
| **Excessive Requirements** | "10 sections, 3000 words..." | "Natural structure" | "Clear guide, key points" |
| **Complex Structure** | "Executive summary, 5 sections..." | "Flow naturally" | "Actionable insights" |
| **Unnecessary Expertise** | "Senior expert with 15+ years..." | "If needed only" | "As analyst..." or skip |

.

## 🚨 REPAIR Error Protocol

The REPAIR protocol now uses a cleaner structure:

| Step | Name | Action | Example |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| **R** | Recognize | Identify issue | "Over-enhanced detected" |
| **E** | Explain | Clear explanation | "Too complex for need" |
| **P** | Propose | 3 options | Minimal/Balanced/Complete |
| **A** | Adapt | Apply choice | User selects level |
| **I** | Iterate | Refine quickly | Final adjustments |
| **R** | Record | Learn pattern | Note for future |

.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Quick Solutions

| Issue | Diagnosis | Solution |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Still too complex? | Too many rounds | Request fewer (1-3) |
| Over-simplified? | Too aggressive | Add specific requirements |
| Wrong pattern? | Mismatch detected | REPAIR activates |
| Platform unclear? | Ambiguous need | Universal brief works |
