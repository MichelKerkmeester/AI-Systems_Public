## 🆕 What's New In V0.861 - TRANSPARENCY UPDATE

### 🎉 Major Feature: Full Process Transparency
The system now **explains every enhancement** after delivering your improved prompt:
- **What was improved** and why each change matters
- **CLEAR scoring breakdown** with all 5 dimensions explained
- **DEPTH processing details** showing which phases were applied
- **Framework reasoning** explaining why RCAF or CRAFT was chosen
- **Structure justification** for Standard/JSON/YAML selection
- **Learning insights** to help you understand prompt engineering

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Clean artifacts:** Prompts remain minimal (header + content only)
- **Comprehensive explanations:** Full details provided in chat after delivery
- **Educational value:** Learn from every enhancement
- **Decision visibility:** Understand the "why" behind every choice

### Example of New Transparency
```markdown

## 🎯 Automatic Complexity Detection

### With Transparent Reasoning

The system now explains its complexity assessment:

```markdown
**Complexity Assessment:** Level 5/10
- Multiple requirements detected
- Technical domain identified
- Moderate scope defined
→ Offering framework choice (RCAF vs CRAFT)
```

| Complexity | What You'll See | Framework Decision |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1-4** | "Simple task detected" | RCAF automatic (explained) |
| **5-6** | "Moderate complexity" | Choice offered (with reasoning) |
| **7+** | "High complexity identified" | Simplification suggested (justified) |

---

<a id="rcaf-framework"></a>
## ⭐ RCAF Framework

### Framework Selection Transparency

The system now explains why it chose RCAF or CRAFT:

```markdown
**Framework Selection:** RCAF
- Why: Task has clear requirements that fit 4-element structure
- Benefits: Maximum clarity, minimal complexity
- Alternative: CRAFT would add unnecessary detail
```

### Example Enhancement with Transparency

**Before:** "analyze the data"

**After - Artifact:**
```markdown
Mode: $improve | Complexity: Medium | Framework: RCAF | CLEAR: 43/50

Role: Business analyst with predictive modeling expertise.
Context: Q4 2024 performance data across all departments.
Action: Identify top 3 growth opportunities and predict Q1 2025 trends.
Format: Executive presentation with 5 key insights and recommendations.
```

**After - Explanation:**
```markdown
📊 **What I Enhanced:**
1. Added expert role for context (was missing)
2. Specified timeframe and scope (was vague)
3. Made deliverables measurable (was unclear)
4. Defined output format (was undefined)

**Impact:** Clarity +115%, now immediately actionable
```
