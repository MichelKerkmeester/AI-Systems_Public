## 📖 Overview

The Prompt Engineering Assistant helps users craft powerful, precise prompts through systematic simplification and challenge-based thinking. Version 8.2.0 introduces emergency commands for quick recovery, enhanced conversation history integration, and progressive context learning stages. The system actively questions complexity while delivering professional-grade prompts that maximize clarity, minimize unnecessary specifications, and offers multiple format options to suit different use cases.

### What is SMILE Format?
SMILE ((: Smile) is an open-source prompt instruction language created by Dr. Thomas Ager, Ph.D. at Cardiff University. It uses emoticon-based brackets to structure prompts for Large Language Models, designed to increase instruction following while maintaining readability.

## 📄 Format Options

### Standard Format (Default)
- **Purpose**: Natural language clarity, maximum readability
- **Token Impact**: Baseline
- **Best For**: Most prompts, human understanding, simple to moderate complexity
- **Always Available**: Yes

Example:
```
As a data analyst, analyze Q4 sales data focusing on revenue drivers and growth patterns. 
Create an executive summary with actionable insights.
```

### JSON Format
- **Purpose**: Structured for APIs and programmatic use
- **Token Impact**: Usually -5% to +5%
- **Best For**: Technical integration, system interfaces, structured data
- **Availability**: When structured data benefits
- **Pattern Learning**: System tracks when you prefer JSON

Example:
```json
{
  "role": "data_analyst",
  "task": "analyze_q4_sales",
  "focus": ["revenue_drivers", "growth_patterns"],
  "output": "executive_summary",
  "requirements": ["actionable_insights"]
}
```

### SMILE Format
- **Purpose**: Enhanced instruction following through emoticon structure
- **Token Impact**: +20-30% typically
- **Best For**: Complex multi-step instructions, detailed requirements
- **Availability**: Complexity > 3 or when structure helps
- **Pattern Tracking**: System learns your SMILE usage preferences

Example:
```
(: Sales Analysis Task
  [: Role [ Data analyst ] :]
  [= Task =] Analyze Q4 sales data
  
  [: Requirements [
    [! Priority: Revenue drivers !]
    • Growth pattern analysis
    • Trend identification
    • Actionable insights
  ] :]
  
  [: Output Format [
    Executive Summary
    {Key findings with data}
    {Strategic recommendations}
  ] :]
) :)
```

### Format Selection Guide (v0.820 Enhanced)

| Complexity | Recommended | Alternative | Pattern Context | Token Note |
|------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Simple (1-3) | Standard | - | Previous choices shown | Baseline |
| Moderate (4-6) | Standard | JSON if API, SMILE if structured | Format history displayed | Monitor overhead |
| Complex (7-10) | SMILE | Standard with sections | SMILE preference tracked | +20-30% justified |

## 🧠 ATLAS Thinking Framework

### How ATLAS Works (v0.820 Enhanced Process)

| Phase | Action | Challenge Point | Pattern Integration | Output |
|-------|--------|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Assess** | Map clarity, find gaps | "Is this necessary?" | Search history | Issue list |
| **Transform** | Generate options | Create simpler alternatives | Use patterns | 3 versions |
| **Layer** | Build progressively | Stop when sufficient | Apply preferences | Enhanced prompt |
| **Assess Impact** | Validate changes | Check value vs. complexity | Verify improvement | Metrics |
| **Format** | Apply optimal format | "Standard sufficient?" | Check format history | Final format |
| **Synthesize** | Select optimal | Apply final polish | Present all options | Delivered artifact |

### Challenge Mode with Calibration

| Thinking Rounds | Base Intensity | Calibrated By | Final Challenge | Pattern Note |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1-2 | None | - | No challenge | History shown |
| 3-4 | Gentle | Acceptance rate | Adaptive | Preferences noted |
| 5-6 | Constructive | Historical data | Personalized | Patterns applied |
| 7-8 | Strong | User preference | Customized | History influences |
| 9-10 | Maximum | Past responses | Full context | Complete tracking |

### User Interaction (MANDATORY v0.820)
```
**How many thinking rounds would you like? (1-10, or 'auto')**

Based on your request, I recommend: **5 rounds**
• **Clarity:** Low - needs structure
• **Complexity:** High - multi-step process
• **Enhancement:** Comprehensive - significant improvement possible
• **Format benefit:** SMILE could help with structure

[Previous patterns: You've averaged 4.7 rounds for similar prompts]
[Format history: SMILE used 40% for complex prompts]
[Challenge calibration: Constructive (based on 45% acceptance)]

**Your choice?**
```

## 🚀 Challenge Mode Philosophy

### The Challenge Manifesto (Calibrated & Pattern-Aware)
> "Every feature has a cost. Every complexity adds friction. Every format adds tokens. Start with the absolute minimum that delivers value. Let success drive expansion, not speculation. Learn from every choice and adapt to preferences."

### Calibrated Challenge Levels

| Level | Acceptance History | Approach | Example |
|-------|-------------------|----------|---------|
| **Gentle** | < 30% | Light suggestions | "Could this be simpler?" |
| **Constructive** | 30-70% | Balanced alternatives | "Simpler might work better..." |
| **Strong** | > 70% | Aggressive simplification | "Let's focus on the core ask" |

### Common Challenges with Calibration

| Situation | Before | Challenge (Calibrated) | Pattern Context | After |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Over-Specification** | "React, TypeScript, Redux..." | [Strong] "Platform chooses tools" | You prefer minimal 70% | "Task app, universal" |
| **Complex Workflow** | "10-step process..." | [Constructive] "Structure helps?" | SMILE helped before | `(: Workflow :)` |
| **API Integration** | "Multiple endpoints..." | [Gentle] "JSON for structure?" | JSON preferred for APIs | Structured fields |
| **Simple Request** | "Write a blog post..." | [None] Keep it simple | Standard typical | Natural language |
