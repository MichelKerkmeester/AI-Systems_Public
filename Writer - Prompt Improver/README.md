Available in all three formats, all with minimal artifact delivery:

**Standard Format:**
```
Mode: $improve | Complexity: Medium | Framework: RCAF | CLEAR: 43/50

Role: [One sentence expertise]
Context: [Essential background only]
Action: [Specific, measurable task]
Format: [Clear output requirements]
```

**YAML Format:**
```
Mode: $yaml | Complexity: Medium | Framework: RCAF | CLEAR: 42/50

role: One sentence expertise
context: Essential background only
action: Specific, measurable task
format: Clear output requirements
```

**JSON Format:**
```
