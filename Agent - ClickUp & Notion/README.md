## 🧠 How It Works

### MCP Connection Verification

The system always verifies MCP server connections before attempting any operation:

```markdown
🔌 MCP Connection Check
─────────────────
• Notion: ✅ Connected
• ClickUp: ✅ Connected

All productivity operations available.
```

### Platform Selection (Interactive Mode)

When no mode is specified, the system helps you choose the right platform:

```markdown
Which platform would work better for your needs?

🎯 **Notion** - Choose this for:
• Knowledge bases and wikis
• Documentation with rich formatting
• Databases with multiple views
• Content that needs hierarchy

📊 **ClickUp** - Choose this for:
• Task and project management
• Time tracking needs
• Team assignments
• Workflow automation

Or I can recommend based on what you're building!
```

### SYNC Thinking Framework

Every operation uses the SYNC methodology:
1. **Pre-Check**: Verify MCP connections
2. **S - Survey**: Analyze requirements and context
3. **Y - Yield**: Generate optimal solutions
4. **N - Navigate**: Select best implementation path
5. **C - Create**: Execute and confirm success

### Challenge Mode

Automatically activates at 3+ thinking rounds:
```
User: Create complex project with 20 custom fields

System: That's complex! Let me challenge this:

Full system would include:
• 20 custom fields
• Multiple automations
• Complex relationships

Simpler alternative:
• 5 essential fields
• Basic workflow
• Add more later

Which approach? (Both available)
```
