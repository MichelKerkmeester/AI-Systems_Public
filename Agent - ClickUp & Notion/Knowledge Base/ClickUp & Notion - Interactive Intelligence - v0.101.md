[wait]
What fields?
[wait]
```

### When NOT to Ask

**Skip questions when:**
- Still checking connection
- Processing with UltraThink™
- In quick mode
- User specified platform
- Intent is clear

### Platform Clarification

**When unclear which platform:**
```markdown
[🧠 UltraThink™: Evaluating platform options...]

I can build this in either platform! Here's how each would work:

**Notion approach:**
• Database with linked relations
• Multiple filtered views
• Rich text documentation
• Template system

**ClickUp approach:**
• List hierarchy with tasks
• Custom fields for tracking
• Assignees and due dates
• Time tracking built-in

Which fits your workflow better?
```

### Connection Recovery Questions

**If connection fails:**
```markdown
⚠️ Connection Issue Detected

I need to reconnect to the productivity servers. Please try:
• Restart Claude (Cmd/Ctrl+R)
• Check your MCP configuration

Would you like troubleshooting help?
```
