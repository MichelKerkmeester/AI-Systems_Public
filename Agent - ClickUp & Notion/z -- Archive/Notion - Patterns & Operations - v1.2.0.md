## 1. 🎯 INTENT RECOGNITION ENGINE

### Confidence Scoring with Thinking Guidance
| Confidence | Range | Action | Thinking Rounds | Example |
|------------|-------|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **Exact** | >0.95 | Execute immediately | Ask: 2-3 recommended | "project tracker" |
| **High** | 0.80-0.95 | Proceed with defaults | Ask: 3-5 recommended | "track projects" |
| **Medium** | 0.50-0.79 | Confirm understanding | Ask: 5-7 recommended | "organizer" |
| **Low** | <0.50 | Use full guidance | Ask: 7-10 recommended | "help with stuff" |

### Pattern Matching Hierarchy
```
1. Exact Match → Direct pattern execution (2-3 thinking rounds)
2. Synonym Recognition → Map to known pattern (3-4 thinking rounds)
3. Category Detection → Identify pattern group (4-6 thinking rounds)
4. Composite Understanding → Combine patterns (6-8 thinking rounds)
5. Context Inference → Use workspace/history (7-10 thinking rounds)
```

### Intent Categories with Thinking Defaults

## 10. 🎯 PATTERN APPLICATION

### Selection Logic with Thinking Integration
1. Check exact trigger match (>0.95 confidence) → 2-3 rounds
2. Analyze context clues → 3-4 rounds
3. Consider user history → 4-5 rounds
4. Apply smart defaults → 5-6 rounds
5. Ask only if <0.50 confidence → 7-10 rounds

### Intent Detection Flow with Thinking
```
User Input
    ↓
Category Detection (workspace/content/organization/query)
    ↓
Pattern Matching (exact → synonym → category)
    ↓
Confidence Assessment
    ↓
Ask for Thinking Rounds
    ↓
Execution Path Selection
```

### Quality Standards with Thinking Transparency
Every pattern creates:
- Essential properties only
- Helpful default views
- Scalable structure
- Clear naming
- Best practices applied
- **Transparent thinking process**
- **User-controlled optimization depth**

### Performance Guidelines with Thinking Optimization
- Small database: <1,000 items (instant) → 2-3 rounds
- Medium: 1,000-10,000 (use filters) → 4-5 rounds
- Large: 10,000-50,000 (aggressive filtering + archive) → 6-8 rounds

### Thinking Round Allocation

| Complexity | Rounds | Focus Areas |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **Simple** | 2-3 | Basic structure, essential properties |
| **Standard** | 4-6 | Views, filters, basic relations |
