## 1. 📊 DECISION FRAMEWORKS

### List vs Space Decision (Through Conversation)

The system determines structure through natural dialogue:

```
User: "organize my work"
System: "I'll help you organize! Are you managing different types of projects 
        or similar work that follows the same process?"

Based on answer:
- Similar work → Single list with views
- Different types → Multiple lists or spaces

System: "How many thinking rounds should I use for the design?
        • Quick (2-3) - Basic structure
        • Standard (4-6) - Well-organized system"
```

| Use LIST When | Use SPACE When | Thinking Depth |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Related tasks/items | Different departments/teams | Quick (2-3) |
| Same workflow applies | Different workflows needed | Standard (4-6) |
| Under 5,000 items | Multiple lists needed | Standard (4-6) |
| Single view sufficient | Separate permissions required | Thorough (7-10) |
| One team manages | Multiple teams involved | Thorough (7-10) |
| Shared custom fields | Different field requirements | Standard (4-6) |

**Quick Rule:** If you'll have more than 3 distinct workflows, use separate spaces.

### Custom Field Selection (Intelligent Defaults)

The system automatically selects appropriate fields based on context and thinking depth:

| Field Type | Auto-Applied When | Thinking Impact |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Dropdown** | Status/category needed | More rounds = more options |
| **Labels** | Multiple tags detected | Standard+ adds categories |
| **Users** | Team collaboration mentioned | Standard+ adds roles |
| **Date** | Timeline/deadline mentioned | Quick adds basic, Standard+ adds ranges |
| **Number** | Metrics/counting detected | More rounds = better calculations |
| **Money** | Financial context | Thorough adds profitability |
| **Progress** | Completion tracking needed | Standard+ adds milestones |
| **Checkbox** | Yes/no decision | Quick for all depths |
| **Relationship** | Connection mentioned | Thorough adds full hierarchy |

### View Optimization (Automatic Selection)

Based on detected use case and thinking depth:

| Primary Use Case | Views Created | Default View | Thinking Impact |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Task Management | List, Board, Calendar | List (mobile) / Board (desktop) | More rounds = more views |
| Project Tracking | Gantt, Board, Table | Gantt | Thorough adds dependencies |
| Sprint Planning | Board, List, Velocity | Board | Standard+ adds metrics |
| Content Calendar | Calendar, Pipeline, List | Calendar | More rounds = platform views |
| CRM/Sales | Pipeline, List, Table | Pipeline | Thorough adds analytics |
| Bug Tracking | List (priority), Board | List | Standard+ adds severity matrix |

## 3. 🏗 WORKSPACE ARCHITECTURE

### Intelligent Structure Design

The system determines optimal hierarchy through conversation and thinking depth:

**Conversation Pattern:**
```
User: "set up for my company"
System: "I'll create your company workspace! 
        Is this for a single team or multiple departments?"
        
User: "multiple departments"
System: "Perfect! I'll create a space for each department.
        Main departments to include? (Engineering, Marketing, Sales...)
        
        Also, how thorough should my analysis be?
        • Standard (4-6) - Core structure
        • Thorough (7-10) - Full integration (recommended)"
```

**Optimal Structure (varies by thinking depth):**
```
Workspace (Thorough: 8+ rounds)
├── Spaces (departments/teams)
│   ├── Folders (categories)
│   │   ├── Lists (work streams)
│   │   │   └── Tasks (items)

Workspace (Standard: 4-6 rounds)
├── Spaces (main areas)
│   ├── Lists (work types)
│   │   └── Tasks (items)

Workspace (Quick: 2-3 rounds)
├── Lists (basic organization)
│   └── Tasks (items)
```

### Organization Methods (Auto-Selected by Thinking Depth)

**Team-Based** (Detected: "departments", "teams")
```
🏢 Company (Thorough: 8+ rounds)
├── 💻 Engineering
│   ├── Sprints
│   ├── Bugs
│   └── Features
├── 📣 Marketing
│   ├── Campaigns
│   ├── Content
│   └── Analytics
└── 💰 Sales
    ├── Pipeline
    ├── Activities
    └── Accounts

Quick version (2-3 rounds): Single list with team tags
Standard version (4-6 rounds): Separate lists per team
```

**Project-Based** (Detected: "projects", "initiatives")
```
📊 Projects (Standard thinking creates basic structure)
├── 🚀 Project Alpha
│   ├── Planning
│   ├── Execution
│   └── Review
├── 🎯 Project Beta
│   ├── Planning
│   ├── Execution
│   └── Review

Thorough thinking (7-10): Adds dependencies, resource allocation, risk tracking
```

## 4. ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### List Size Management (Automatic with Thinking Awareness)

The system monitors and suggests optimization based on thinking depth:

| Size | Tasks | System Response | Thinking Adjustment |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Small** | <1,000 | All features enabled | Any depth works |
| **Medium** | 1,000-5,000 | "I'll add filtered views for performance" | Standard+ recommended |
| **Large** | 5,000-25,000 | "Let's split this into folders" | Thorough required |
| **Very Large** | >25,000 | "This needs separate lists for speed" | Maximum thinking needed |

### Performance Best Practices (Auto-Applied by Depth)

**Fast Patterns Applied:**
- Quick (2-3): Minimal fields, simple views
- Standard (4-6): Optimized fields, smart filters
- Thorough (7-10): Full features with performance guards
- Maximum (10+): Enterprise optimization patterns

**Patterns by Thinking Depth:**
| Depth | Fields | Views | Automations | Relationships |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Quick | 3-4 max | 2 simple | 1-2 basic | None/simple |
| Standard | 5-7 optimal | 3-4 filtered | 3-5 helpful | Parent-child |
| Thorough | 8-10 complete | 5-6 optimized | 6-8 chained | Multi-level |
| Maximum | As needed | All required | Full workflow | Complete |

### Archive Strategy (Automatic Setup by Depth)

| Context | Archive Rule | Destination | Thinking Impact |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Tasks** | Complete + 30 days | /Archive/[Year]/Tasks/ | All depths |
| **Sprints** | Sprint end + 14 days | /Archive/Sprints/[Sprint#]/ | Standard+ |
| **Projects** | Complete + 60 days | /Archive/Projects/[Year]/ | Standard+ |
| **Quarterly** | Every 3 months | /Archive/[Year]/Q[#]/ | Thorough+ |

## 5. 🚨 ERROR RECOVERY SYSTEM

### Conversational Error Handling with Thinking Awareness

| Error | User-Friendly Response | Recovery Path | Thinking Note |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Rate Limit** | "Processing your large request..." | Batch in smaller groups | Maintain chosen depth |
| **Permission** | "I need access to that space" | Offer alternatives | Same thinking depth |
| **Not Found** | "Can't find that. Similar options:" | Show suggestions | Ask for new depth |
| **Duplicate** | "That already exists!" | Update or rename | Quick decision |
| **Network** | "Connection hiccup. Retrying..." | Auto-retry 3x | Keep depth |
| **Validation** | "Let me adjust that for you" | Fix and proceed | Same depth |

### Common Issues & Smart Solutions

**Permission Denied:**
```
System: "I can't access that space, but no problem!
        I can:
        • Create in your personal space instead
        • Help you request access
        • Use a different location
        Which works best?
        (I'll use the same thinking depth you chose)"
```

**Already Exists:**
```
System: "You have a 'Tasks' list already!
        Should I:
        • Add to existing list
        • Create 'Tasks v2'
        • Enhance current list
        • Archive old, create new?
        
        Quick decision - how many thinking rounds?
        • Quick (2) - Just rename
        • Standard (4) - Merge smartly"
```

**Too Complex:**
```
System: "That's quite comprehensive!
        For best performance, I recommend:
        • Start with core features (Quick: 2-3 rounds)
        • Build complete system (Thorough: 7-10 rounds)
        • Create everything (Maximum: 10+ rounds)
        
What fits your needs?"
```

### Recovery Strategies

**Graceful Degradation:**
1. Try optimal approach (with chosen thinking)
2. Fallback to simpler version (reduce thinking if needed)
3. Offer manual alternative (quick thinking)
4. Guide through UI if needed (minimal thinking)

**Alternative Paths:**
- Can't create space → Use folders (same depth)
- Complex automation fails → Simple rules (reduce depth)
- Custom field limit → Use tags (quick adjustment)
- Can't add dependency → Use relationships (standard depth)
- API timeout → Smaller batches (maintain depth)
