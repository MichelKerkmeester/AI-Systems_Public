## 1. 📊 DECISION FRAMEWORKS

### List vs Space Decision (Through Conversation)

The system determines structure through natural dialogue:

```
User: "organize my work"
System: "I'll help you organize! Are you managing different types of projects 
        or similar work that follows the same process?"

Based on answer:
- Similar work → Single list with views
- Different types → Multiple lists or spaces
```

| Use LIST When | Use SPACE When |
|---------------|----------------|
| Related tasks/items | Different departments/teams |
| Same workflow applies | Different workflows needed |
| Under 5,000 items | Multiple lists needed |
| Single view sufficient | Separate permissions required |
| One team manages | Multiple teams involved |
| Shared custom fields | Different field requirements |

**Quick Rule:** If you'll have more than 3 distinct workflows, use separate spaces.

### Custom Field Selection (Intelligent Defaults)

The system automatically selects appropriate fields based on context:

| Field Type | Auto-Applied When | Example Context |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Dropdown** | Status/category needed | Status, Priority, Phase |
| **Labels** | Multiple tags detected | Features, Skills, Tags |
| **Users** | Team collaboration mentioned | Assignee, Reviewer |
| **Date** | Timeline/deadline mentioned | Due date, Start date |
| **Number** | Metrics/counting detected | Hours, Points, Count |
| **Money** | Financial context | Budget, Revenue, Cost |
| **Progress** | Completion tracking needed | % Complete, Progress |
| **Checkbox** | Yes/no decision | Approved, Billable |
| **Relationship** | Connection mentioned | Linked to, Blocks |

### View Optimization (Automatic Selection)

Based on detected use case, views are automatically configured:

| Primary Use Case | Views Created | Default View |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Task Management | List, Board, Calendar | List (mobile) / Board (desktop) |
| Project Tracking | Gantt, Board, Table | Gantt |
| Sprint Planning | Board, List, Velocity | Board |
| Content Calendar | Calendar, Pipeline, List | Calendar |
| CRM/Sales | Pipeline, List, Table | Pipeline |
| Bug Tracking | List (priority), Board | List |

## 2. 🏗 WORKSPACE ARCHITECTURE

### Intelligent Structure Design

The system determines optimal hierarchy through conversation:

**Conversation Pattern:**
```
User: "set up for my company"
System: "I'll create your company workspace! 
        Is this for a single team or multiple departments?"
        
User: "multiple departments"
System: "Perfect! I'll create a space for each department.
        Main departments to include? (Engineering, Marketing, Sales...)"
```

**Optimal Structure:**
```
Workspace
├── Spaces (departments/teams)
│   ├── Folders (categories)
│   │   ├── Lists (work streams)
│   │   │   └── Tasks (items)
```

### Organization Methods (Auto-Selected)

**Team-Based** (Detected: "departments", "teams")
```
🏢 Company
├── 💻 Engineering
│   ├── Sprints
│   ├── Bugs
│   └── Features
├── 📣 Marketing
│   ├── Campaigns
│   ├── Content
│   └── Analytics
└── 💰 Sales
    ├── Pipeline
    ├── Activities
    └── Accounts
```

**Project-Based** (Detected: "projects", "initiatives")
```
📊 Projects
├── 🚀 Project Alpha
│   ├── Planning
│   ├── Execution
│   └── Review
├── 🎯 Project Beta
│   ├── Planning
│   ├── Execution
│   └── Review
```

**Client-Based** (Detected: "clients", "customers", "agency")
```
👥 Clients
├── 🏢 Client A
│   ├── Projects
│   ├── Tasks
│   └── Communication
├── 🏢 Client B
│   ├── Projects
│   ├── Tasks
│   └── Communication
```

### Naming Conventions (Applied Automatically)

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Spaces** | [Emoji] [Department/Team] | 💻 Engineering |
| **Folders** | [Category] - [Descriptor] | Projects - Active |
| **Lists** | [Type] : [Specific] | Sprint : 23 |
| **Tasks** | [Action] [Object] | Review Homepage Design |
| **Templates** | [TEMPLATE] [Name] | TEMPLATE Sprint Planning |
| **Archives** | [ARCHIVE] [Year] [Type] | ARCHIVE 2024 Completed |

---

## 3. ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### List Size Management (Automatic)

The system monitors and suggests optimization:

| Size | Tasks | System Response |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Small** | <1,000 | All features enabled |
| **Medium** | 1,000-5,000 | "I'll add filtered views for performance" |
| **Large** | 5,000-25,000 | "Let's split this into folders" |
| **Very Large** | >25,000 | "This needs separate lists for speed" |

### Performance Best Practices (Auto-Applied)

**Fast Patterns Applied:**
- Limit to 5-7 visible custom fields
- Simple AND filters by default
- Archive automation for 30+ day old items
- List view for large datasets
- Limited dependencies
- Simple automation rules

**Patterns Avoided:**
- Excessive custom fields
- Complex nested filters
- Too many relationships
- Unfiltered large views
- Chain automations
- Multiple formula fields

### Archive Strategy (Automatic Setup)

| Context | Archive Rule | Destination |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Tasks** | Complete + 30 days | /Archive/[Year]/Tasks/ |
| **Sprints** | Sprint end + 14 days | /Archive/Sprints/[Sprint#]/ |
| **Projects** | Complete + 60 days | /Archive/Projects/[Year]/ |
| **Quarterly** | Every 3 months | /Archive/[Year]/Q[#]/ |

## 4. 🚨 ERROR RECOVERY SYSTEM

### Conversational Error Handling

| Error | User-Friendly Response | Recovery Path |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Rate Limit** | "Processing your large request..." | Batch in smaller groups |
| **Permission** | "I need access to that space" | Offer alternatives |
| **Not Found** | "Can't find that. Similar options:" | Show suggestions |
| **Duplicate** | "That already exists!" | Update or rename |
| **Network** | "Connection hiccup. Retrying..." | Auto-retry 3x |
| **Validation** | "Let me adjust that for you" | Fix and proceed |

### Common Issues & Smart Solutions

**Permission Denied:**
```
System: "I can't access that space, but no problem!
        I can:
        • Create in your personal space instead
        • Help you request access
        • Use a different location
        Which works best?"
```

**Already Exists:**
```
System: "You have a 'Tasks' list already!
        Should I:
        • Add to existing list
        • Create 'Tasks v2'
        • Enhance current list
        • Archive old, create new?"
```

**Too Complex:**
```
System: "That's quite comprehensive!
        For best performance, I recommend:
        • Start with core features (2 min)
        • Build complete system (5 min)
        • Create everything (10 min)
        What fits your timeline?"
```

### Recovery Strategies

**Graceful Degradation:**
1. Try optimal approach
2. Fallback to simpler version
3. Offer manual alternative
4. Guide through UI if needed

**Alternative Paths:**
- Can't create space → Use folders
- Complex automation fails → Simple rules
- Custom field limit → Use tags
- Can't add dependency → Use relationships
- API timeout → Smaller batches

## 5. 🎯 BEST PRACTICES

### Essential Custom Fields (Auto-Selected by Context)

Every list gets context-appropriate fields:

**Task Lists:**
1. Status (workflow)
2. Priority (urgency)
3. Due Date (deadlines)
4. Assignee (ownership)
5. Time Estimate (planning)
6. Category (organization)

**Project Lists:**
1. Phase (stage)
2. Timeline (date range)
3. Budget (money)
4. Owner (user)
5. Risk Level (dropdown)
6. Progress (percentage)

### Status Workflow Design (Intelligent Selection)

**Standard Task Flow:**
```
To Do → In Progress → Review → Complete
```

**Development Flow:**
```
Backlog → Ready → In Development → Testing → Deploy → Done
```

**Content Flow:**
```
Idea → Research → Writing → Editing → Review → Published
```

**Sales Flow:**
```
Lead → Qualified → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed Won/Lost
```

### Automation Patterns (Auto-Configured)

**Time-Saving Automations Applied:**
```yaml
Status Complete → Archive after 30 days
Due date approaching → Priority to High
Task created → Assign to project owner
Sprint ends → Move incomplete to next
Priority Urgent → Add to Today view
Overdue → Send notification
```

### Relationship Configuration

**Smart Relationship Setup:**
- Dependencies for project tasks
- Client → Project → Task for agencies
- Epic → Story → Subtask for development
- Goal → Project → Task for OKRs

**Guidelines Applied:**
- Max 3-4 relationship levels
- No circular dependencies
- Clear parent-child structure
- Documented connections

## 6. 👥 COLLABORATION PATTERNS

### Permission Setup (Conversation-Based)

```
System: "Who needs access to this?
        • Just you (private)
        • Your team (collaborate)
        • Clients too (guest access)"
        
Based on answer, applies appropriate permissions
```

### Permission Levels Applied

| Level | Granted Abilities | Use Case |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Owner** | Full control | Workspace admin |
| **Admin** | Manage everything | Team leads |
| **Member** | Create and edit | Team members |
| **Guest** | View and comment | Clients/stakeholders |

### Team Collaboration Features

**Automatically Enabled for Teams:**
- Multiple assignees option
- @mentions in comments
- Shared views
- Team workload view

## 7. 📈 SCALABILITY GUIDELINES

### Growth Planning (Proactive)

The system plans for growth:

**Starting Small:**
```
System: "I'm setting this up to grow with you!
        Starting simple, but ready to scale when needed."
```

**Growth Indicators Monitored:**
- List approaching 1000 items → Suggest folders
- Multiple similar lists → Suggest space
- Team > 10 people → Suggest department spaces
- Clients > 5 → Suggest client folders

### When to Split (Automatic Suggestions)

| Indicator | System Suggestion |
|-----------|------------------|
| >10 team members | "Consider department spaces" |
| >5 active clients | "Let's create client folders" |
| >100 tasks/project | "Project needs own list" |
| >1000 items/list | "Time to add folders" |
| Yearly transition | "Archive last year's work" |

### Migration Support

**From Other Tools (Detected in conversation):**
```
User: "moving from Trello"
System: "I'll structure this to make migration easy!
        Your boards → lists, cards → tasks, with enhanced features!"

User: "we use Jira"
System: "Perfect! I'll match Jira's structure:
        Projects → spaces, epics → folders, issues → tasks!"
```

---

## 8. 🎨 TEMPLATE INTELLIGENCE

### Template Creation (Automatic)

When patterns repeat, system suggests templates:

```
System: "I notice you're creating similar projects!
        Should I save this as a template for next time?"
```

### Smart Template Components

**Every Template Includes:**
1. Pre-configured custom fields
2. Standard subtasks/checklist
3. Description template
4. Default assignee logic
5. Automation triggers

### Template Types (Context-Based)

| Detected Pattern | Template Created |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Repeated sprints | Sprint template with ceremonies |
| Similar projects | Project template with phases |
| Regular meetings | Meeting note template |
| Client onboarding | Client setup template |
| Content creation | Content template with workflow |

---

## 9. 📱 CROSS-PLATFORM OPTIMIZATION

### Device Detection & Optimization

```
System: "I'll optimize this for how you work!
        Primarily desktop, mobile, or both?"
        
Based on answer:
- Mobile → Simplified views, fewer fields
- Desktop → Full features, complex views
- Both → Dual view strategy
```

### View Strategy by Platform

| Platform | Primary View | Fields Shown | Features |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **Mobile** | List | 3-4 essential | Quick add, swipe actions |
| **Tablet** | Board | 5-6 key fields | Drag-drop, filters |
| **Desktop** | Table/Gantt | All relevant | Bulk edit, advanced filters |

### Responsive Design Patterns

**Mobile Optimization:**
- Me Mode for personal tasks
- Simplified list views
- Quick action buttons
- Minimal fields visible
- Swipe gestures enabled

**Desktop Power Features:**
- Multi-column board views
