## 1. 📊 DECISION FRAMEWORKS

### Database vs Page Decision Matrix with Thinking Guidance

| Use DATABASE When | Use PAGE When | Thinking Rounds |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Multiple similar items | One-off unique content | 3-5 for database |
| Need filtering/sorting | Static information | 2-3 for page |
| Properties required | Long-form writing | 4-6 for complex db |
| Different views needed | Hierarchical docs | 2-3 for simple page |
| Tracking over time | Simple notes | 5-7 for tracking system |
| Calculations needed | Reference material | 6-8 for formulas |

**Quick Rule:** If you'll have more than 5 similar items, use a database (ask user: 3-5 thinking rounds recommended).

### Property Type Selection with Thinking Optimization

| Property Type | Use When | Example | Thinking Focus |
|--------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Select** | Finite options, one choice | Status, Priority | 2 rounds for options |
| **Multi-select** | Multiple attributes | Tags, Skills | 3 rounds for taxonomy |
| **Person** | Assignment/ownership | Owner, Assignee | 2 rounds for permissions |
| **Date** | Time-specific | Due date, Created | 3 rounds for automation |
| **Number** | Calculations needed | Hours, Budget | 4 rounds for formulas |
| **Text** | Unique content | Notes, Description | 2 rounds basic |
| **Checkbox** | Binary state | Done, Active | 2 rounds simple |
| **Relation** | Connect databases | Project→Tasks | 5-6 rounds for design |
| **Formula** | Auto-calculate | Days until due | 6-7 rounds complex |
| **Rollup** | Aggregate related | Sum of subtasks | 7-8 rounds advanced |

### View Optimization Matrix with Thinking Requirements

| View Type | Best For | When to Use | Avoid When | Thinking |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Table** | Data comparison | Desktop, bulk edit | Mobile use | 3 rounds |
| **Board** | Workflow/status | Visual management | Many groups | 4 rounds |
| **Calendar** | Date-driven | Scheduling | No dates | 3 rounds |
| **List** | Simple display | Mobile, reading | Complex data | 2 rounds |
| **Gallery** | Visual content | Media, cards | Text-heavy | 4 rounds |
| **Timeline** | Project planning | Date ranges | Single dates | 5 rounds |

## 2. 🗏 WORKSPACE ARCHITECTURE

### Organization Methods with Thinking Approach

**PARA Method** (5-6 thinking rounds)
```
📁 Projects (active, time-bound)
📁 Areas (ongoing responsibilities)  
📁 Resources (future reference)
📁 Archive (inactive items)
Thinking focus: Categorization and boundaries
```

**GTD System** (6-8 thinking rounds)
```
📥 Inbox (capture)
📋 Next Actions (by context)
🗓️ Calendar (time-specific)
📁 Projects (multi-step)
📌 Someday/Maybe
📚 Reference
Thinking focus: Workflow and contexts
```

**Action-Reference Split** (3-4 thinking rounds)
```
🎯 Active (current work)
📚 Reference (information)
🗄️ Archive (completed)
Thinking focus: Simple separation
```

### Hierarchy Best Practices with Thinking Depth

**✅ Optimal (3 levels max):** (3-4 thinking rounds)
```
Workspace
├── Areas
│   ├── Projects
│   │   └── Items
```

**❌ Avoid (too deep):** (Would need 8-10 rounds to untangle)
```
Workspace
├── Department
│   ├── Team
│   │   ├── Sub-team
│   │   │   ├── Projects
│   │   │   │   └── Tasks (5 levels!)
```

### Naming Conventions with Thinking Consistency

| Type | Pattern | Example | Thinking |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Databases** | [Emoji] [Plural Noun] | 📊 Projects | 2 rounds |
| **Projects** | [Year] [Name] | 2025 Website Redesign | 2 rounds |
| **Archives** | Archive - [Year/Type] | Archive - 2024 Tasks | 3 rounds |
| **Templates** | [Type] Template | Meeting Template | 3 rounds |
| **Dashboards** | [Area] Dashboard | Sales Dashboard | 4 rounds |

## 3. ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Database Size Guidelines with Thinking Requirements

| Size | Items | Performance | Strategy | Thinking |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Small** | <1,000 | Instant | All features available | 2-3 rounds |
| **Medium** | 1,000-10,000 | Good | Use filtered views | 4-5 rounds |
| **Large** | 10,000-50,000 | Slower | Aggressive filtering + archive | 6-8 rounds |
| **Very Large** | >50,000 | Poor | Split into multiple databases | 9-10 rounds |

### Performance Best Practices with Thinking Focus

**Fast Patterns:** (2-3 thinking rounds)
- Show 3-5 properties in views
- Simple filters (AND logic)
- Index on select/status properties
- Limit formula complexity
- Archive regularly

**Slow Patterns to Avoid:** (Need 5-7 rounds to fix)
- Showing all properties
- Complex OR filter chains
- Many rollups visible
- Nested formulas
- Unconstrained date ranges

### Archive Strategy with Thinking Planning

| Archive Trigger | Timing | Destination | Thinking |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Status-based** | Complete + 30 days | /Archive/[Year]/ | 4 rounds |
| **Time-based** | Quarterly | /Archive/[Year]/Q[#]/ | 5 rounds |
| **Size-based** | >10,000 items | /Archive/[Database]/ | 6 rounds |

**Archive Rules:** (5-6 thinking rounds for complete strategy)
- Preserve all relations
- Maintain properties
- Keep searchable
- Create archive views

## 4. 🚨 ERROR RECOVERY SYSTEM

### API Error Handling with Thinking Adaptation

| Error | User Message | Recovery | Thinking |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Rate Limit** | "Working on that..." | Queue with backoff | 2 rounds adapt |
| **Permission** | "Need access. Try personal space?" | Offer alternatives | 3-4 rounds rethink |
| **Not Found** | "Can't find X. Did you mean Y?" | Suggest similar | 3 rounds search |
| **Validation** | "I'll adjust that for you" | Auto-correct | 4 rounds fix |
| **Network** | "Connection issue. Retrying..." | Automatic retry | 2 rounds wait |

### Common Issues & Solutions with Thinking Recovery

| Issue | Cause | Solution | Thinking |
|-------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Circular Relations** | A→B→A loop | Use one-way relation | 5 rounds redesign |
| **Formula Too Complex** | Nested calculations | Break into steps | 6 rounds simplify |
| **View Overload** | Too many views | Archive unused | 4 rounds optimize |
| **Slow Database** | Too many items | Filter + archive | 7 rounds restructure |
| **Lost Items** | Wrong filter | Check archive/filters | 3 rounds debug |

### Recovery Strategies with Adaptive Thinking

**Graceful Degradation Path:**
```
1. Optimal → Full features (original thinking)
2. Reduced → Core features only (3 extra rounds)
3. Minimal → Basic structure (2 extra rounds)
4. Manual → Guide user steps (1 round guidance)
```

**Alternative Approaches:** (Ask user for extra thinking rounds)
- Can't create here → Different location (2-3 extra)
- Complex relation fails → Use tags (3-4 extra)
- Permission denied → Personal space (2 extra)
- Template fails → Manual structure (4-5 extra)

### Interactive Recovery Examples with Thinking

**Permission Error:**
```
⚠️ I need permission to access that location.

No problem! I can:
• Create this in your personal space instead
• Help you request access from admin
• Suggest an alternative location

Which works best?

(This will need 2-3 extra thinking rounds to adapt the structure)
```

**Complex Recovery:**
```
The structure hit some complexity limits.

I can:
1. Simplify with core features (3 rounds to redesign)
2. Split into smaller components (5 rounds to architect)
3. Use a different approach (7 rounds to reimagine)

What's your preference and how many thinking rounds should I use?
```

## 5. 🎯 BEST PRACTICES

### Essential Properties with Thinking Design
Every database should include (3-4 thinking rounds for property design):
1. **Title** - Clear, searchable name
2. **Status** - Current state/workflow
3. **Date** - Created, due, or relevant date
4. **Owner** - Who's responsible
5. **Category** - For grouping/filtering

### Formula Patterns with Thinking Complexity

**Days Until Due:** (3 thinking rounds)
```
if(prop("Due"), dateBetween(prop("Due"), now(), "days"), empty())
```

**Status Indicator:** (4 thinking rounds)
```
if(prop("Complete"), "✅", 
  if(prop("Due") < now(), "⚠️ Overdue", "⏳"))
```

**Progress Percentage:** (5 thinking rounds)
```
round(prop("Completed") / prop("Total") * 100)
```

### Relation Best Practices with Design Thinking

**One-to-Many (Most Common):** (3-4 thinking rounds)
- Project → Tasks
- Client → Projects
- Team → Members

**Many-to-Many (Use Sparingly):** (5-7 thinking rounds)
- Skills ↔ People
- Tags ↔ Items
- Resources ↔ Projects

**Self-Referencing:** (6-8 thinking rounds)
- Parent Task → Subtasks
- Related Documents
- Dependencies
