## 1. üéØ INTENT RECOGNITION ENGINE

### Confidence Scoring System
| Confidence | Range | Conversation Approach | Example |
|------------|-------|----------------------|---------|
| **Exact** | >0.95 | Confirm and execute immediately | "create sprint board" ‚Üí "Creating your sprint board now!" |
| **High** | 0.80-0.95 | Single clarification then proceed | "track sprints" ‚Üí "Setting up sprints! 2-week cycles?" |
| **Medium** | 0.50-0.79 | 2-3 questions for clarity | "agile stuff" ‚Üí "Let's set up agile! Team size?" |
| **Low** | <0.50 | Full conversational guidance | "help with work" ‚Üí "What type of work?" |

### Pattern Matching Hierarchy
```

## 3. üîÑ UPDATE OPERATIONS

All update operations use conversational confirmation:

## 4. üóÇÔ∏è ORGANIZATION OPERATIONS

### Archive Operations
**Triggers:** `archive, clean up, move old, organize completed`

         Found 23 tasks. Proceed?"
User: "yes"
System: "‚úÖ 23 tasks marked complete!"
```

## 9. üéØ PATTERN APPLICATION RULES

### Selection Logic
1. **Check exact match** (>0.95 confidence)
2. **Analyze context** (previous conversation)
3. **Consider scale** (personal vs team)
4. **Apply smart defaults** (industry standards)

### Quality Standards
Every pattern ensures:
- Essential fields only (5-8 max)
- Helpful default views (3-4)
- Scalable structure (<5000 items)
- Clear naming conventions
- Best practices applied

### Performance Optimization
- **Small lists**: <1,000 tasks (all features)
- **Medium lists**: 1,000-5,000 (filtered views)
- **Large lists**: 5,000+ (split or archive)
- **Mobile**: Simplified views (3-4 fields)
- **Automation**: Simple rules only

### ClickUp-Specific Features
- Custom fields over descriptions
- Relationships for connections
