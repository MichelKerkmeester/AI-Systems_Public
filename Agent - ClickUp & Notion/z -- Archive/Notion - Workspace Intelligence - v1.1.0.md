## 1. 📊 DECISION FRAMEWORKS

### Database vs Page Decision Matrix

| Use DATABASE When | Use PAGE When |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Multiple similar items | One-off unique content |
| Need filtering/sorting | Static information |
| Properties required | Long-form writing |
| Different views needed | Hierarchical docs |
| Tracking over time | Simple notes |
| Calculations needed | Reference material |

**Quick Rule:** If you'll have more than 5 similar items, use a database.

### Property Type Selection

| Property Type | Use When | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **Select** | Finite options, one choice | Status, Priority |
| **Multi-select** | Multiple attributes | Tags, Skills |
| **Person** | Assignment/ownership | Owner, Assignee |
| **Date** | Time-specific | Due date, Created |
| **Number** | Calculations needed | Hours, Budget |
| **Text** | Unique content | Notes, Description |
| **Checkbox** | Binary state | Done, Active |
| **Relation** | Connect databases | Project→Tasks |
| **Formula** | Auto-calculate | Days until due |
| **Rollup** | Aggregate related | Sum of subtasks |

### View Optimization Matrix

| View Type | Best For | When to Use | Avoid When |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Table** | Data comparison | Desktop, bulk edit | Mobile use |
| **Board** | Workflow/status | Visual management | Many groups |
| **Calendar** | Date-driven | Scheduling | No dates |
| **List** | Simple display | Mobile, reading | Complex data |
| **Gallery** | Visual content | Media, cards | Text-heavy |
| **Timeline** | Project planning | Date ranges | Single dates |

## 2. 🏗️ WORKSPACE ARCHITECTURE

### Organization Methods

**PARA Method**
```
📁 Projects (active, time-bound)
📁 Areas (ongoing responsibilities)  
📁 Resources (future reference)
📁 Archive (inactive items)
```

**GTD System**
```
📥 Inbox (capture)
📋 Next Actions (by context)
🗓️ Calendar (time-specific)
📝 Projects (multi-step)
📌 Someday/Maybe
📚 Reference
```

**Action-Reference Split**
```
🎯 Active (current work)
📚 Reference (information)
🗄️ Archive (completed)
```

### Hierarchy Best Practices

**✅ Optimal (3 levels max):**
```
Workspace
├── Areas
│   ├── Projects
│   │   └── Items
```

**❌ Avoid (too deep):**
```
Workspace
├── Department
│   ├── Team
│   │   ├── Sub-team
│   │   │   ├── Projects
│   │   │   │   └── Tasks (5 levels!)
```

### Naming Conventions

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Databases** | [Emoji] [Plural Noun] | 📊 Projects |
| **Projects** | [Year] [Name] | 2025 Website Redesign |
| **Archives** | Archive - [Year/Type] | Archive - 2024 Tasks |
| **Templates** | [Type] Template | Meeting Template |
| **Dashboards** | [Area] Dashboard | Sales Dashboard |

## 3. ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Database Size Guidelines

| Size | Items | Performance | Strategy |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Small** | <1,000 | Instant | All features available |
| **Medium** | 1,000-10,000 | Good | Use filtered views |
| **Large** | 10,000-50,000 | Slower | Aggressive filtering + archive |
| **Very Large** | >50,000 | Poor | Split into multiple databases |

### Performance Best Practices

**Fast Patterns:**
- Show 3-5 properties in views
- Simple filters (AND logic)
- Index on select/status properties
- Limit formula complexity
- Archive regularly

**Slow Patterns to Avoid:**
- Showing all properties
- Complex OR filter chains
- Many rollups visible
- Nested formulas
- Unconstrained date ranges

### Archive Strategy

| Archive Trigger | Timing | Destination |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| **Status-based** | Complete + 30 days | /Archive/[Year]/ |
| **Time-based** | Quarterly | /Archive/[Year]/Q[#]/ |
| **Size-based** | >10,000 items | /Archive/[Database]/ |

**Archive Rules:**
- Preserve all relations
- Maintain properties
- Keep searchable
- Create archive views

## 4. 🚨 ERROR RECOVERY SYSTEM

### API Error Handling

| Error | User Message | Recovery |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Rate Limit** | "Working on that..." | Queue with backoff |
| **Permission** | "Need access. Try personal space?" | Offer alternatives |
| **Not Found** | "Can't find X. Did you mean Y?" | Suggest similar |
| **Validation** | "I'll adjust that for you" | Auto-correct |
| **Network** | "Connection issue. Retrying..." | Automatic retry |

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Circular Relations** | A→B→A loop | Use one-way relation |
| **Formula Too Complex** | Nested calculations | Break into steps |
| **View Overload** | Too many views | Archive unused |
| **Slow Database** | Too many items | Filter + archive |
| **Lost Items** | Wrong filter | Check archive/filters |

### Recovery Strategies

**Graceful Degradation Path:**
```
1. Optimal → Full features
2. Reduced → Core features only  
3. Minimal → Basic structure
4. Manual → Guide user steps
```

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Can't create here → Different location
- Complex relation fails → Use tags
- Permission denied → Personal space
- Template fails → Manual structure

### Interactive Recovery Examples

**Permission Error:**
```
⚠️ I need permission to access that location.

No problem! I can:
• Create this in your personal space instead
• Help you request access from admin
• Suggest an alternative location

Which works best?
```

**Ambiguous Request:**
```
I want to make sure I understand correctly!

When you say "tracker," are you thinking:
• Task tracker for to-dos
• Project tracker for larger work
• Habit tracker for daily activities
• Something else?

Let me know and I'll build exactly what you need!
```

## 5. 🎯 BEST PRACTICES

### Essential Properties
Every database should include:
1. **Title** - Clear, searchable name
2. **Status** - Current state/workflow
3. **Date** - Created, due, or relevant date
4. **Owner** - Who's responsible
5. **Category** - For grouping/filtering

### Formula Patterns

**Days Until Due:**
```
if(prop("Due"), dateBetween(prop("Due"), now(), "days"), empty())
```

**Status Indicator:**
```
if(prop("Complete"), "✅", 
  if(prop("Due") < now(), "⚠️ Overdue", "⏳"))
```

**Progress Percentage:**
```
round(prop("Completed") / prop("Total") * 100)
```

### Relation Best Practices

**One-to-Many (Most Common):**
- Project → Tasks
- Client → Projects
- Team → Members

**Many-to-Many (Use Sparingly):**
- Skills ↔ People
- Tags ↔ Items
- Resources ↔ Projects

**Self-Referencing:**
- Parent Task → Subtasks
- Related Documents
- Dependencies

## 6. 👥 COLLABORATION PATTERNS

### Permission Levels

| Level | Can Do | Can't Do | Use For |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Full Access** | Everything | - | Admins |
| **Edit Content** | Add/edit items | Change structure | Team members |
| **Comment Only** | View + comment | Edit | Reviewers |
| **View Only** | See content | Change anything | Stakeholders |

### Sharing Best Practices

**Databases:**
- Default: Edit content
- Lock structure to prevent breaks
- Hide sensitive properties

**Pages:**
- Default: View only for external
- Include subpages when sharing
- Enable duplication for templates

### Team Patterns

**Task Assignment:**
- One owner per task
- Clear handoff process
- Status indicates action needed
- @mentions for urgency

**Review Process:**
- Draft → Review → Approved
- Comments for feedback
- Lock when approved
- Version in properties

## 7. 📈 SCALABILITY GUIDELINES

### Growth Planning

**Phase 1: Simple Start**
- Basic properties only
- Single database
- 1-2 views
- Manual processes

**Phase 2: Enhancement**
- Add helpful properties
- Create filtered views
- Add templates
- Simple relations

**Phase 3: Scale**
- Split large databases
- Add rollups/formulas
- Create dashboards
- Automation patterns

### When to Split Databases

| Split By | When | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Time** | >10,000 items | Tasks 2024, Tasks 2025 |
| **Type** | Different properties | Active vs Archived |
| **Team** | Different workflows | Marketing vs Dev |
| **Status** | Performance issues | Open vs Closed |

### Migration Patterns

**From Other Tools:**
- Excel → Rows become items, columns become properties
- Trello → Boards become databases, lists become status
- Asana → Projects become databases, tasks remain tasks
- Google Sheets → Direct CSV import

## 8. 🎨 TEMPLATE DESIGN

### Smart Template Components

**Every Template Includes:**
1. Standard properties pre-filled
2. Common sections/blocks
3. Linked relations where applicable
4. Status set to starting state
5. Date defaults (today, +7 days, etc.)

### Template Patterns

| Template Type | Auto-Include | Default Values |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Project** | Tasks, Timeline, Resources | Status: Planning |
| **Meeting** | Agenda, Notes, Actions | Date: Today |
| **Task** | Subtasks, Notes | Priority: Medium |
| **Note** | Tags, References | Created: Now |

---

## 9. 📱 CROSS-PLATFORM DESIGN

### Mobile Optimization

**Mobile-Friendly:**
- List views (not tables)
- 3-4 properties maximum
- Large touch targets
- Simple navigation

**Desktop-Optimized:**
- Table views with many columns
- Complex dashboards
- Bulk operations
- Keyboard shortcuts

### Responsive Patterns

| Platform | Default View | Properties Shown | Avoid |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-------|
| **Mobile** | List | Title, Status, Date | Wide tables |
| **Tablet** | Board | 4-5 key properties | Dense layouts |
| **Desktop** | Table | All relevant | - |
