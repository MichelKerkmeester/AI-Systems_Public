## 1. 🎯 INTENT RECOGNITION ENGINE

### Confidence Scoring
| Confidence | Range | Action | Example |
|------------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Exact** | >0.95 | Execute immediately | "project tracker" |
| **High** | 0.80-0.95 | Proceed with defaults | "track projects" |
| **Medium** | 0.50-0.79 | Confirm understanding | "organizer" |
| **Low** | <0.50 | Use full guidance | "help with stuff" |

### Pattern Matching Hierarchy
```
1. Exact Match → Direct pattern execution
2. Synonym Recognition → Map to known pattern  
3. Category Detection → Identify pattern group
4. Composite Understanding → Combine patterns
5. Context Inference → Use workspace/history
```

### Intent Categories
- **Workspace Creation**: CRM, project management, business systems
- **Content Creation**: Pages, notes, documentation
- **Organization**: Archive, clean up, restructure
- **Query**: Search, filter, find items
- **Update**: Status changes, assignments, dates

## 5. 🔍 QUERY OPERATIONS

### Time-Based Queries
| Query | Filter Logic | Sort |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Today** | `date = today() OR (overdue AND !complete)` | Priority, Time |
| **This Week** | `date >= start_of_week() AND <= end_of_week()` | Date ascending |
| **Overdue** | `date < today() AND status != Complete` | Date ascending |
| **This Month** | `date in current_month()` | Date ascending |

### Person Queries
| Query | Filter Logic |
|-------|-------------|
| **My Items** | `assigned = current_user()` |
| **Unassigned** | `assigned is empty` |
| **Team Items** | `assigned in team_members()` |
| **By Person** | `group by assigned_to` |

### Status Queries
| Query | Filter Logic |
|-------|-------------|
| **Active** | `status in [In Progress, Active]` |
| **Completed** | `status = Complete` |
| **Needs Attention** | `status in [Blocked, At Risk]` |
| **Not Started** | `status = Not Started` |

## 6. 📦 BULK OPERATIONS

| Operation | Triggers | Process | Confirmation |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Bulk Complete** | `mark all done, complete all` | Update in batches of 50 | "✅ Updated X items" |
| **Bulk Create** | `add list, create multiple` | Parse list, create items | "✅ Created X items" |
| **Bulk Archive** | `archive all completed` | Move to archive | "📦 Archived X items" |
| **Bulk Assign** | `assign all to` | Update person property | "👥 Assigned X items" |

### List Parsing
```
Detects: Line breaks, commas, bullets, numbers
Extracts: Dates (@tomorrow), People (@john), Tags (#urgent)
```

## 10. 🎯 PATTERN APPLICATION

### Selection Logic
1. Check exact trigger match (>0.95 confidence)
2. Analyze context clues
3. Consider user history
4. Apply smart defaults
5. Ask only if <0.50 confidence

### Intent Detection Flow
```
User Input
    ↓
Category Detection (workspace/content/organization/query)
    ↓
Pattern Matching (exact → synonym → category)
    ↓
Confidence Assessment
    ↓
Execution Path Selection
```

### Quality Standards
Every pattern creates:
- Essential properties only
- Helpful default views
- Scalable structure
- Clear naming
- Best practices applied

### Performance Guidelines
- Small database: <1,000 items (instant)
- Medium: 1,000-10,000 (use filters)
- Large: 10,000-50,000 (aggressive filtering + archive)
- Very large: >50,000 (split databases)
