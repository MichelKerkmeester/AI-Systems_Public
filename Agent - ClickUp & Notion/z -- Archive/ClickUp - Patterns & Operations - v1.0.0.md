# ClickUp - Patterns & Operations - v1.0.0

Comprehensive pattern library and operation reference for natural language to ClickUp mapping.

## 1. 🎯 INTENT RECOGNITION ENGINE

### Confidence Scoring
| Confidence | Range | Action | Example |
|------------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Exact** | >0.95 | Execute immediately | "sprint board" |
| **High** | 0.80-0.95 | Proceed with defaults | "track sprints" |
| **Medium** | 0.50-0.79 | Confirm understanding | "agile stuff" |
| **Low** | <0.50 | Use interactive mode | "help with work" |

### Pattern Matching Hierarchy
```
1. Exact Match → Direct pattern execution
2. Synonym Recognition → Map to known pattern  
3. Category Detection → Identify pattern group
4. Composite Understanding → Combine patterns
5. Context Inference → Use workspace/history
```

## 5. 🔍 QUERY OPERATIONS

### Time-Based Queries
| Query | Filter Logic | Sort |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **Today** | `due_date = today() OR (overdue AND !complete)` | Priority, Time |
| **This Week** | `due_date >= start_of_week() AND <= end_of_week()` | Due date ascending |
| **Overdue** | `due_date < today() AND status != Complete` | Due date ascending |
| **This Sprint** | `sprint = current_sprint()` | Priority descending |
| **This Month** | `due_date in current_month()` | Due date ascending |

### Assignee Queries
| Query | Filter Logic |
|-------|-------------|
| **My Tasks** | `assignees contains current_user()` |
| **Unassigned** | `assignees is empty` |
| **Team Tasks** | `assignees in team_members()` |
| **By Person** | `group by assignees` |
| **Workload** | `assignees with sum(time_estimate)` |

### Status Queries
| Query | Filter Logic |
|-------|-------------|
| **Active** | `status in [In Progress, Review]` |
| **Blocked** | `status = Blocked OR dependencies blocked` |
| **Completed** | `status = Done OR Complete` |
| **Ready** | `status = To Do AND no blockers` |

### Priority Queries
| Query | Filter Logic |
|-------|-------------|
| **Urgent** | `priority = Urgent` |
| **High Priority** | `priority in [Urgent, High]` |
| **Quick Wins** | `time_estimate < 1h AND priority >= Normal` |

## 6. 📦 BULK OPERATIONS

| Operation | Triggers | Process | Confirmation |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Bulk Complete** | `mark all done, complete all` | Update in batches of 100 | "✅ Updated X tasks" |
| **Bulk Create** | `add list, create multiple, import` | Parse and create items | "✅ Created X tasks" |
| **Bulk Archive** | `archive completed, clean up` | Move to archive | "📦 Archived X items" |
| **Bulk Assign** | `assign all to` | Update assignee field | "👥 Assigned X tasks" |
| **Bulk Reschedule** | `move all to [date]` | Update due dates | "📅 Rescheduled X tasks" |
| **Bulk Tag** | `tag all with` | Add tags to items | "🏷️ Tagged X items" |

### List Parsing
```
Detects: Line breaks, commas, bullets, numbers
Extracts: Dates (@tomorrow), People (@john), Priority (!high), Time (2h)
Creates: Individual tasks with parsed attributes
```

## 10. 🎯 PATTERN APPLICATION

### Selection Logic
1. Check exact trigger match (>0.95 confidence)
2. Analyze context clues
3. Consider user history
4. Apply smart defaults
5. Ask only if <0.50 confidence

### Quality Standards
Every pattern creates:
- Essential custom fields only
- Helpful default views
- Scalable structure
- Clear naming
- Best practices applied

### Performance Guidelines
- Small list: <1,000 tasks (instant)
- Medium: 1,000-5,000 (use filters)
- Large: 5,000-25,000 (aggressive filtering + folders)
- Very large: >25,000 (split into spaces)

### ClickUp-Specific Optimizations
- Use custom fields over description parsing
- Leverage ClickApps when beneficial
- Enable time tracking for billable work
- Use dependencies for complex projects
- Configure automations for recurring patterns
