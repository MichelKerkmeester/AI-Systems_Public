# Adaptive Rules for Planning & Specification

Rules and strategies for adapting parallel planning based on requirement clarity, stakeholder complexity, and architectural uncertainty.

## Planning Complexity Assessment

### Complexity Factors

```yaml
planning_factors:
  requirements:
    stakeholders:
      low: 1-2
      medium: 3-5
      high: >5
    user_stories:
      low: <5
      medium: 5-12
      high: >12
    acceptance_criteria:
      low: <10
      medium: 10-25
      high: >25

  technical:
    architectural_decisions:
      low: <3
      medium: 3-7
      high: >7
    integration_points:
      low: 0-2
      medium: 3-6
      high: >6
    new_technologies:
      low: 0
      medium: 1-2
      high: >2

  constraints:
    regulatory_compliance:
      none: 0
      moderate: 1-2
      strict: >2
    performance_requirements:
      basic: standard_perf
      demanding: high_perf
      critical: real_time
    security_level:
      standard: basic_auth
      elevated: encryption
      critical: zero_trust
```

### Planning Complexity Score

```python
def calculate_planning_complexity(factors):
    weights = {
        'stakeholders': 0.15,
        'user_stories': 0.15,
        'acceptance_criteria': 0.10,
        'architectural_decisions': 0.20,
        'integration_points': 0.15,
        'new_technologies': 0.10,
        'compliance': 0.10,
        'security_level': 0.05
    }

    score = 0
    for factor, value in factors.items():
        if value in ['low', 'none', 'basic', 'standard', 0] or value < thresholds[factor].low:
            points = 1
        elif value in ['medium', 'moderate', 'demanding', 'elevated'] or value < thresholds[factor].medium:
            points = 2
        else:
            points = 3
        score += points * weights[factor]

    return score * 33.33  # Normalize to 0-100
```

## Requirement Clarity Assessment

### Clarity Indicators

```yaml
clarity_indicators:
  specification:
    goal_clarity:
      clear: well_defined_objectives
      unclear: vague_objectives
      ambiguous: conflicting_objectives

    scope_definition:
      clear: explicit_boundaries
      fuzzy: implicit_boundaries
      undefined: no_boundaries

    success_metrics:
      defined: measurable_kpis
      partial: qualitative_only
      missing: no_metrics

  constraints:
    known_constraints:
      complete: all_identified
      partial: some_identified
      unknown: discovery_needed

    priorities:
      clear: ranked_by_value
      unclear: all_high_priority
      conflicting: contradictory
```

### Clarity Score Calculation

```python
def calculate_clarity(indicators):
    weights = {
        'goal_clarity': 0.30,
        'scope_definition': 0.25,
        'success_metrics': 0.20,
        'known_constraints': 0.15,
        'priorities': 0.10
    }

    score = 0
    for indicator, value in indicators.items():
        if value in ['clear', 'defined', 'complete']:
            points = 3
        elif value in ['fuzzy', 'partial', 'unclear']:
            points = 2
        else:
            points = 1
        score += points * weights[indicator]

    return (score / 3) * 100  # Normalize to 0-100
```

## Adaptive Strategies

```

## Dynamic Adjustments

### Runtime Monitoring

```python
class PlanningMonitor:
    def adjust_strategy(self, metrics):
        if metrics.ambiguity_count > 5:
            self.add_clarification_round()

        if metrics.stakeholder_conflicts > 2:
            self.add_alignment_session()

        if metrics.risk_count > 10:
            self.increase_risk_analysis_depth()

        if metrics.dependency_cycles_found:
            self.add_architecture_review()
```

### Progressive Refinement

```yaml
refinement_stages:
  stage_1_rough:
    scope: high_level_only
    details: minimal
    validation: conceptual
    checkpoint: direction_approval

  stage_2_detailed:
    scope: component_level
    details: thorough
    validation: technical
    checkpoint: approach_approval

  stage_3_comprehensive:
    scope: implementation_ready
    details: complete
    validation: comprehensive
    checkpoint: final_approval

  stage_4_refined:
    scope: edge_cases_risks
    details: exhaustive
    validation: stakeholder_aligned
    checkpoint: commitment
```

## Fallback Strategies

### Graceful Degradation Path

```
1. Full Parallel Planning (4 analysts)
   ↓ (conflicting perspectives)
2. Sequential with Reconciliation
   ↓ (clarity issues)
3. Discovery + Iterative Planning
   ↓ (stakeholder misalignment)
4. Phased Consensus Building
   ↓ (too complex)
5. Break into Sub-plans
   ↓ (complete failure)
6. External Facilitation Required
```

### Recovery Actions

```yaml
on_conflicting_requirements:
  - document_all_perspectives
  - create_comparison_matrix
  - facilitate_stakeholder_meeting
  - establish_priority_framework
  - get_executive_decision

on_missing_information:
  - document_assumptions
  - identify_information_owners
  - schedule_discovery_sessions
  - create_information_checklist
  - proceed_with_flags

on_unclear_priorities:
  - apply_value_scoring
  - estimate_effort_ranges
  - create_decision_matrix
  - facilitate_prioritization
  - document_rationale

on_architectural_uncertainty:
  - research_approaches
  - create_proof_of_concepts
  - evaluate_alternatives
  - document_trade_offs
  - recommend_with_confidence_levels
```

## Optimization Rules

### Planning Workflow Optimization

```python
def optimize_planning_workflow(context):
    # Assess planning needs
    complexity = calculate_complexity(context)
    clarity = calculate_clarity(context)

    # Select optimal workflow
    if clarity > 70 and complexity < 40:
        return 'streamlined_planning'
    elif clarity < 40:
        return 'discovery_first'
    elif complexity > 70:
        return 'phased_detailed_planning'
    else:
        return 'standard_parallel'
```

### Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

```python
def optimize_stakeholder_engagement(stakeholders):
    strategy = {
        'high_involvement': [],
        'review_approval': [],
        'keep_informed': []
    }

    for sh in stakeholders:
        if sh.decision_authority or sh.domain_expert:
            strategy['high_involvement'].append(sh)
        elif sh.approval_required:
            strategy['review_approval'].append(sh)
        else:
            strategy['keep_informed'].append(sh)

    return strategy
```

## Risk Analysis Adaptation

### Risk Assessment Depth

```yaml
risk_depth_by_criticality:
  low_criticality:
    identification: basic
    assessment: qualitative
    mitigation: optional
    monitoring: periodic

  medium_criticality:
    identification: thorough
    assessment: semi_quantitative
    mitigation: planned
    monitoring: regular

  high_criticality:
    identification: exhaustive
    assessment: quantitative
    mitigation: detailed_plans
    monitoring: continuous
    additions:
      - contingency_plans
      - escalation_procedures
```

## Configuration Examples

```

## Success Metrics

### Planning Quality Metrics

```yaml
metrics:
  requirement_completeness:
    target: >95%
    measure: defined_requirements / total_requirements

  stakeholder_alignment:
    target: >90%
    measure: approved_aspects / total_aspects

  risk_coverage:
    target: >85%
    measure: identified_risks / expected_risks

  architectural_clarity:
    target: >90%
    measure: defined_components / total_components

  estimation_confidence:
    target: >75%
    measure: high_confidence_estimates / total_estimates

  approval_efficiency:
    target: <3_iterations
    measure: approval_rounds_needed
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Start with why (business value)
- Involve stakeholders early
- Document assumptions explicitly
- Consider alternatives
- Define success metrics

### DON'T:
- Skip stakeholder alignment
- Ignore constraints
- Over-commit on timelines
- Leave risks unmitigated
- Assume requirements are static

### ALWAYS:
- Validate understanding
- Document decisions and rationale
- Consider technical debt
- Plan for change
- Get explicit approval before proceeding
