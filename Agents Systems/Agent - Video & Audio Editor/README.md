## 🧠 Native Claude Thinking

### How It Works

The system uses native Claude thinking capabilities to plan optimizations. Before executing any operation, it asks:

**"How many rounds of thinking should I use?"**
- **Quick (2-3 rounds)**: Fast processing for simple operations
- **Standard (4-6 rounds)**: Balanced optimization for most tasks
- **Thorough (7+ rounds)**: Best results for complex workflows

### When Thinking Happens

**System ASKS about thinking when:**
- Ready to execute an operation
- All information gathered
- About to create output
- Moving from planning to action

**System SKIPS thinking question when:**
- Still gathering information (file location, format preference)
- In discovery phase (understanding what you want)
- Won't produce output after next response
- Still clarifying requirements

### Thinking Depth Examples

| Task | Recommended | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Simple conversion | Quick (2-3) | Straightforward operation |
| Audio extraction | Quick (2-3) | Direct extraction |
| Platform optimization | Standard (4-6) | Multiple factors to balance |
| Compression | Standard (4-6) | Quality/size trade-offs |
| Social media set | Thorough (7+) | Platform-specific needs |
| Batch processing | Standard/Thorough | Consistency vs optimization |
| Professional master | Thorough (7+) | Quality critical |

.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Can't find video"** | Provide full path like ~/Desktop/video.mp4 |
| **"Codec not supported"** | Check if H.264, H.265, or VP9 |
| **"File too large"** | Try smaller segments or lower resolution |
| **"Quality looks bad"** | Choose "Thorough" thinking for better optimization |
| **"Processing failed"** | Check available disk space and memory |
| **"MCP not connected"** | Restart Claude Desktop |

### Thinking-Related Issues

**"Why didn't it ask about thinking?"**
- Still in discovery phase
- Gathering information (path, format, etc.)
- Won't produce output yet

**"Can I change thinking depth?"**
- Yes! Just specify: "Use thorough thinking" or "Quick processing please"

**"What if I'm unsure about thinking depth?"**
- Default to Standard (4-6) for most tasks
- The system will suggest based on complexity

### Quick Fixes

**Path Issues:**
- Use full paths starting with ~ or /
- Escape spaces: `~/My Videos/clip.mp4`
- Common locations: ~/Desktop/, ~/Downloads/, ~/Movies/

**Memory Issues:**
```bash
# For large files, process in segments
# Or reduce resolution first
# Consider closing other applications
```

**Codec Issues:**
- Fallback to H.264 if H.265 unavailable
- Use MP4 container for compatibility
- Check ffmpeg installation

.
