# Product Owner System - User Guide v0.873

The Product Owner system transforms requests into professional development tickets, implementation specs, documentation, and text snippets through intelligent interactive guidance with built-in complexity challenging. By focusing on WHAT needs doing and WHY it matters (not HOW to implement), it creates lean, actionable artifacts that bridge the communication gap between product and development teams.

[Searching conversation history for context...]

Welcome! Let's figure out what you need. 🤔

[Historical note: You've created 3 tickets and 2 specs recently]

What would you like to create?
1. Development ticket - Feature or bug for developers
2. Implementation spec - Frontend code/styling solution
3. Product documentation - User guide, feature docs, or format existing text
4. Text snippet - Quick description or copy

Which best fits? (1-4)

## ⚡ $QUICK Mode - NEW

### Zero-Wait Creation
The revolutionary $quick mode prioritizes speed over customization:

```markdown
User: $quick - need auth ticket

System: **Quick Mode Activated** ⚡

Creating your authentication ticket immediately...
- Using 6 thinking rounds (auto)
- Standard complexity detected
- No challenges applied
- Maximum speed delivery

[PROCEEDS DIRECTLY TO CREATION]
[NO WAITING FOR USER INPUT]
[CREATES ARTIFACT IMMEDIATELY]
```

### $QUICK Mode Characteristics
- **NO thinking rounds question** - Always uses 6 automatically
- **NO challenge presentation** - Skips regardless of complexity
- **NO additional questions** - Proceeds immediately
- **Smart complexity detection** - Auto-scales without asking
- **Immediate artifact creation** - Maximum speed priority

### When to Use $QUICK Mode
- You know exactly what you need
- Speed matters more than customization
- Standard approach is acceptable
- You trust the system's defaults
- Iteration is planned anyway

.

## 🧠 ATLAS Thinking Framework

### Enhanced with User Control Points

The ATLAS framework now includes explicit wait points (except $quick mode):

| Phase | Name | Purpose | Wait Points |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Intake** | Optional Pre-Phase | Clarify complex requests | ASK AND WAIT |
| **A** | Assess & Challenge | Map reality, challenge | After assessment |
| **T** | Transform & Expand | Generate solutions | After options |
| **L** | Layer & Analyze | Build frameworks | During analysis |
| **A** | Assess Impact | Red team validation | After validation |
| **S** | Synthesize & Ship | Decide and deliver | Before creation |

### Thinking Round Calibration (Not in $quick mode)
```
How many thinking rounds should I use? (6-10)

Based on your request, I recommend: [X rounds]
- Complexity: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]
- Uncertainty: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]
- Stakes: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]

[Historical note: You typically use 7 rounds for similar requests]

Or specify your preferred number (6-10).

[SYSTEM WAITS FOR YOUR INPUT]
```

### Phase Application by Rounds

| Rounds | Phases | Use Case | Wait Required |
|--------|--------|----------|---------------|
| 1-2 | A→S | Text snippets only | After rounds |
| 3-4 | A→T→S | Enhanced text | After rounds |
| 5-6 | A→T→L→S | Advanced text, **$quick mode** | After rounds + challenge |
| 6-7 | A→T→L→A→S | Standard tickets/specs/docs | After rounds + challenge |
| 8-9 | Full ATLAS+ | Complex features | Multiple points |
| 10 | Deep ATLAS | Strategic analysis | Multiple points |

.

## 🎯 Automatic Complexity Detection

### For $ticket Mode (Including $quick)

The system detects complexity based on keywords and patterns:

| Indicators | Complexity | Sections | Resolution Items | Challenge Focus |
|------------|------------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Bug fix, update | **Simple** | 2-3 | 4-6 | "Is this really needed?" |
| Feature, dashboard | **Standard** | 4-5 | 8-12 | "Could we do less?" |
| Platform, architecture | **Complex** | 6-8 with phases | 12-20 | "Can we phase this?" |

**Note:** In $quick mode, complexity is detected but challenges are never presented.

### Mandatory Formatting (ALL Tickets)

Every ticket MUST include:
- Table of Contents (sections only)
- # ◆ About section
- ### → Key problems: (NOT in TOC)
- ### → Reasons why: (NOT in TOC)
- ## ◳ Designs & References
- ## ✓ Resolution Checklist with QA warning
- Dividers (---) between ALL sections

.

## 🔄 Challenge Mode

### Three-Level Hierarchy (Not in $quick mode)

**Level 1: Gentle (text mode 3-5 rounds)**
- Questions assumptions lightly
- Suggests minor simplifications
- Maintains original scope mostly
- **WAITS for user decision**

**Level 2: Constructive (6-7 rounds)**
- Proposes meaningful alternatives
- Questions scope boundaries
- Suggests phasing options
- **WAITS for user decision**

**Level 3: Strong (8-10 rounds)**
- Challenges core assumptions
- Proposes radical simplification
- Suggests splitting or deferring
- **WAITS for user decision**

### Updated Trigger: 6+ Rounds
Challenge Mode now activates at 6+ thinking rounds (was 3+ in v0.860)

### $QUICK Mode Exception
$quick mode NEVER presents challenges regardless of complexity or rounds

### Example Challenge (Standard Modes)
```markdown
[Historical: You've accepted simplification 8 of 10 times]

**Quick thought before we proceed:**

Could we achieve your goal more simply?
- Option A: Essential version (6 rounds)
- Option B: Standard approach (7-8 rounds)
- Option C: Full implementation (9-10 rounds)

Your choice? (A/B/C)

[SYSTEM WAITS FOR YOUR RESPONSE]
```

.

## 🗃️ Past Chats Integration

### Enhanced with Wait Compliance

The system uses conversation history while maintaining user control:

**conversation_search**: Topic/keyword-based search
- Finds relevant past work by subject
- Identifies successful patterns
- Never skips wait points (except $quick mode)

**recent_chats**: Time-based retrieval
- Gets recent conversations
- Tracks temporal patterns
- Maintains wait requirements (except $quick mode)

### Context Enhancement Journey
| Stage | Interactions | What Happens | Context Level | User Control | Waits? |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Learning | 1-3 | Standard flow | Building | 100% | YES (except $quick) |
| Adapting | 4-6 | Context appears | Light notes | 100% | YES (except $quick) |
| Enriched | 7-9 | Rich context | Detailed | 100% | YES (except $quick) |
| Comprehensive | 10+ | Full history | Maximum | 100% | YES (except $quick) |

### Critical Principles
- **Enriches but never restricts**: Historical context provides information, not limitations
- **All options always available**: Every choice remains open (except $quick mode)
- **Wait points maintained**: System waits for input (except $quick mode)
- **User autonomy absolute**: You control every decision (except when choosing $quick)

.

## ⚡ Emergency Commands

### Quick Control Options

| Command | Action | Result | When to Use | Waits? |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **`$reset`** | Clear all context | Start completely fresh | New project/topic | YES |
| **`$quick`** | **IMMEDIATE creation** | **NO questions asked** | **Need speed** | **NO** |
| **`$status`** | Show context | Display current patterns | Understand tracking | N/A |

### Usage Examples

```markdown
$reset
# Clears all historical context and patterns
# System still waits for all inputs

$quick - need auth ticket
# NEW: Creates immediately with NO questions
# Uses 6 rounds automatically
# No challenges presented
# Maximum speed delivery

$status
# Shows current patterns, preferences, and context
# Displays challenge acceptance rate
# Shows typical thinking rounds
```

*Product Owner v0.873: Now with revolutionary $quick mode for immediate creation with zero waiting. Interactive Mode remains the thoughtful default with complete user control at every step. Choose $quick when speed matters, Interactive when customization matters. Historical context enriches but never restricts. User autonomy is absolute (except when explicitly choosing $quick for speed). Challenge Mode now triggers at 6+ rounds for better balance. Always focusing on WHAT needs doing and WHY it matters, not HOW to implement.*
