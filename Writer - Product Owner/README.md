# Product Owner System - User Guide v8.6.0

The Product Owner system transforms requests into professional development tickets, implementation specs, documentation, and text snippets through intelligent interactive guidance with built-in complexity challenging. By focusing on WHAT needs doing and WHY it matters (not HOW to implement), it creates lean, actionable artifacts that bridge the communication gap between product and development teams.

When no mode is specified:

```
[Searching conversation history for context...]

Welcome! Let's figure out what you need. 🤔

[Historical note: You've created 3 tickets and 2 specs recently]

What would you like to create?
1. Development ticket - Feature or bug for developers
2. Implementation spec - Frontend code/styling solution
3. Product documentation - User guide or feature docs
4. Text snippet - Quick description or copy
5. Document formatting - Clean up and organize existing text

Which best fits? (1-5)
```

## ⚡ Emergency Commands

### Quick Recovery Options

| Command | Action | Result | When to Use |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **`$reset`** | Clear all context | Start completely fresh | New project/topic |
| **`$standard`** | Default flow | Ignore all patterns | Want unbiased process |
| **`$quick`** | Fast creation | Skip discovery phase | Know exactly what needed |
| **`$status`** | Show context | Display current patterns | Understand tracking |

### Usage Examples

```markdown
$reset
# Clears all historical context and patterns
# Perfect for starting new projects

$status
# Shows current patterns, preferences, and context
# Helps understand what's being tracked

$standard
# Uses default flow without any historical influence
# Good when you want unbiased process

$quick - Need auth ticket
# Skips to creation but still asks thinking rounds
# Minimal pattern checking for speed
```

---

## 🗃️ Past Chats Integration

### How It Works
The system uses two tools to search conversation history:

**conversation_search**: Topic/keyword-based search
- Finds relevant past work by subject
- Identifies successful patterns
- Locates similar challenges

**recent_chats**: Time-based retrieval
- Gets recent conversations
- Tracks temporal patterns
- Maintains session continuity

### Context Enhancement Journey
| Stage | Interactions | What Happens | Context Level | User Control |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| Learning | 1-3 | Standard flow | Building | 100% |
| Adapting | 4-6 | Context appears | Light notes | 100% |
| Enriched | 7-9 | Rich context | Detailed | 100% |
| Comprehensive | 10+ | Full history | Maximum | 100% |

### Critical Principles
- **Enriches but never restricts**: Historical context provides information, not limitations
- **All options always available**: Every choice remains open regardless of patterns
- **User autonomy absolute**: You can always override any suggestion
- **Emergency commands available**: $reset clears all history instantly

## 🎯 Automatic Complexity Detection

### For $ticket Mode

The system detects complexity based on keywords and patterns:

| Indicators | Complexity | Sections | Resolution Items | Challenge Focus |
|------------|------------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Bug fix, update | **Simple** | 2-3 | 4-6 | "Is this really needed?" |
| Feature, dashboard | **Standard** | 4-5 | 8-12 | "Could we do less?" |
| Platform, architecture | **Complex** | 6-8 with phases | 12-20 | "Can we phase this?" |

### Mandatory Formatting (ALL Tickets)

Every ticket MUST include:
- Table of Contents (sections only)
- # ◆ About section
- ### → Key problems: (NOT in TOC)
- ### → Reasons why: (NOT in TOC)
- ## ◳ Designs & References
- ## ✓ Resolution Checklist with QA warning
- Dividers (---) between ALL sections

---

## 🔄 Challenge Mode

### Three-Level Hierarchy

**Level 1: Gentle (1-2 rounds)**
- Questions assumptions lightly
- Suggests minor simplifications
- Maintains original scope mostly

**Level 2: Constructive (3-5 rounds)**
- Proposes meaningful alternatives
- Questions scope boundaries
- Suggests phasing options

**Level 3: Strong (6-10 rounds)**
- Challenges core assumptions
- Proposes radical simplification
- Suggests splitting or deferring

### Historical Calibration
The system adapts challenge intensity based on your acceptance rate:
- **>70% acceptance**: Strong challenges (you appreciate them)
- **30-70% acceptance**: Constructive balance
- **<30% acceptance**: Gentle challenges (minimal disruption)

### Example Challenge
```markdown
[Historical: You've accepted simplification 8 of 10 times]

**Quick thought before we proceed:**

Could we achieve your goal more simply?
- Option A: Minimal MVP (1-2 rounds) - Just core feature
- Option B: Standard approach (3-4 rounds) - Full feature
- Option C: Complete platform (5+ rounds) - All bells and whistles

Based on your history, Option A often ships faster with same value.
```

## 📗 Platform Integration

### After Every Creation
```markdown
📦 **Add to your workspace?**

1. **ClickUp** - Task management, sprints
2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only

[Historical: You typically choose ClickUp (80%)]
Which option? (1 or 2)
```

### Pattern Learning
- Tracks your platform preferences by mode
- Learns when you prefer ClickUp vs artifact-only
- Adapts suggestions based on history

---

## 🧠 ATLAS Thinking Framework

### Enhanced with Conversation History

The ATLAS framework searches past conversations to:
- Find similar problems and solutions
- Identify successful patterns
- Avoid past failures
- Calibrate challenge intensity

### The Five Phases

| Phase | Name | Purpose | History Integration |
|-------|------|---------|-------------------|
| **A** | Assess & Challenge | Map reality, challenge | Searches similar problems |
| **T** | Transform & Expand | Generate solutions | Finds successful patterns |
| **L** | Layer & Analyze | Build frameworks | Checks past failures |
| **A** | Assess Impact | Red team | Uses validation patterns |
| **S** | Synthesize & Ship | Decide and deliver | Applies past successes |

### Thinking Round Calibration
```
How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-10)

Based on your request, I recommend: [X rounds]
- Complexity: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]
- Uncertainty: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]
- Stakes: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]

[Historical note: You typically use 4 rounds for similar requests]

Or specify your preferred number (all options available).
```
