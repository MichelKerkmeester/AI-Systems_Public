## 🔧 What's Improved

### 🎯 Transparency Revolution ✅
**Complete Visibility:**
- Users see all 10 DEPTH rounds as they execute with progress indicators
- Cognitive rigor techniques displayed in real-time (assumption audit, perspective inversion, etc.)
- Quality validation shared openly with scores and improvement cycles
- Error recovery shown transparently with resolution strategies

**Educational Value:**
- Users learn methodology while receiving deliverables
- Understanding of WHY decisions are made, not just WHAT is delivered
- Exposure to structured thinking frameworks
- Insight into quality assurance processes

### 🧠 DEPTH + RICCE Integration ✅
**Unified Framework:**
- **RICCE Structure** mapped to **DEPTH Process**
- Role → Define Multiple Perspectives (Discovery)
- Instructions → Task Breakdown (Engineering)
- Context → Provide Context Layers (All Phases)
- Constraints → Establish Success Metrics (Engineering)
- Examples → Validation Across All Phases

**Enhanced Quality:**
- Mechanism-first thinking (WHY before WHAT)
- Priority classification (P0/P1/P2) throughout
- Self-rating on 6 dimensions (targets: 8+ scores)
- Assumption dependencies explicitly flagged

### 🎨 Cognitive Rigor Techniques ✅
**Five Mandatory Frameworks:**
1. **Assumption Audit** - Surface, classify, challenge all hidden assumptions
2. **Perspective Inversion** - Argue opposition first, then synthesize
3. **Constraint Reversal** - Opposite outcome analysis for non-obvious insights
4. **Mechanism First** - Explain principles before tactics
5. **Priority Classification** - P0 (critical), P1 (high-value), P2 (optional) labeling

### 📊 Interactive Mode Enhancements ✅
**Transparent Conversations:**
- Quality self-rating scores displayed to users
- Assumption validation questions visible
- Processing steps shown with emojis and progress
- Pre-delivery validation checklist shared

## 🎯 RICCE Framework Integration

### RICCE + DEPTH: Unified Approach

**RICCE Structure:**
- **R**ole - Define who is analyzing
- **I**nstructions - Break down tasks
- **C**ontext - Build comprehensive understanding
- **C**onstraints - Establish success metrics
- **E**xamples - Validate with real-world patterns

**Mapping to DEPTH:**

| RICCE Element | DEPTH Phase | Transparency | Purpose |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **Role** | Discover | Multiple perspectives shown | "Analyzing as: architect, UX designer, stakeholder..." |
| **Instructions** | Engineer | Task breakdown visible | "Step 1: X, Step 2: Y, Step 3: Z" |
| **Context** | All Phases | Context layers shared | "Technical: [details], Business: [details], User: [details]" |
| **Constraints** | Engineer | Success metrics displayed | "Target: 95%+ completeness, 90%+ clarity" |
| **Examples** | All Phases | Validation shown | "Similar pattern at Company X validates approach" |

**Benefits:**
- Structure (RICCE) + Process (DEPTH) = Complete methodology
- Users see WHAT (structure) and HOW (process)
- Educational transparency throughout
- Quality assured at every step

## 🎯 Automatic Complexity Detection

### For Tickets
| Indicators | Complexity | Sections | Resolution Items | DEPTH | Transparency | Output |
|------------|------------|----------|------------------|-------|--------------|---------|
| bug, fix, typo, update | **Simple** | 2-3 | 4-6 | 10 rounds visible | Full | That specific bug only |
| feature, dashboard, api | **Standard** | 4-5 | 8-12 | 10 rounds visible | Full | Requested feature only |
| platform, architecture, migration | **Complex** | 6-8 | 12-20 | 10 rounds visible | Full | Specified platform only |

**Quick Mode:** 2/3/5 rounds respectively with summary transparency

### Enhanced Template Selection with Tie-Breaking
System includes intelligent tie-breaking for ambiguous cases:
- "bug platform" → Analyzes context, typically Standard template for that bug
- "feature migration" → Complex template for that feature
- Complex keywords override simpler ones
- Defaults to Standard when unclear
- **Important:** Complexity affects TEMPLATE SIZE, not content scope
- **All detection logic shown to user in v0.913**

### Output Guarantee Examples (With Transparency)
```
User: "Fix login bug"
[Shows analysis of "fix" + "bug" keywords]
→ Simple template for THAT login bug only
NOT: Simple template with multiple bugs

User: "Build dashboard"
[Shows analysis of "feature" + "dashboard" keywords]
→ Standard template for THAT dashboard only
NOT: Standard template with extra features

User: "Platform migration"
[Shows analysis of "platform" + "migration" keywords]
→ Complex template for THAT migration only
NOT: Complex template with multiple platforms
```

### Transparency in Complexity Detection (New in v0.913)
```
🎯 **Complexity Analysis:**
Keywords detected: ["feature", "dashboard", "api"]
Complexity score: Standard (4-5 sections)
Template selected: v0.132 Standard
Reasoning: Feature-level work with moderate scope

Proceeding with 10-round DEPTH processing...
