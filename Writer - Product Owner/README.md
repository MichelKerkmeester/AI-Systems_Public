# Product Owner System - User Guide v0.880

The Product Owner system transforms requests into professional development tickets, strategic epics, and documentation through intelligent interactive guidance with built-in complexity challenging. By focusing on WHAT needs doing and WHY it matters (not HOW to implement), it creates lean, actionable artifacts that bridge the communication gap between product and development teams.

## ⚡ $Quick Mode

### Zero-Wait Creation (Including Epics)
The revolutionary $quick mode prioritizes speed over customization:

```markdown
User: $quick - Q1 payments initiative

System: **Quick Mode Activated** ⚡

Creating your payments initiative epic immediately...
- Using 6 thinking rounds (auto)

.

## 🚀 Epic Mode

### Strategic Initiative Planning
The new $epic mode creates strategic initiatives with proper alignment:

```markdown
User: $epic authentication overhaul

System: Let's structure your authentication overhaul epic! 🚀

**How many thinking rounds should I use? (6-10)**

Based on authentication overhaul scope, I recommend: 7 rounds
- Complexity: Medium (single team, quarterly scope)
- Uncertainty: Low (well-defined domain)
- Stakes: High (security critical)

Your choice?
[WAITS FOR USER INPUT]
```

### Epic Complexity Levels

| Level | Sections | Child Tickets | Scope | Timeline | Example |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Initiative** | 4-5 | 3-5 tickets | Single team | Quarterly | Feature rollout |
| **Program** | 6-7 | 6-10 tickets | Multi-team | Half-year | Platform upgrade |
| **Strategic** | 8-10 | 10+ tickets | Company-wide | Annual | Digital transformation |

### Epic Structure Components
- **Strategic Overview**: Business context and vision
- **Success Metrics**: OKRs and KPIs with targets
- **Timeline & Phases**: Quarterly breakdown with milestones
- **Child Tickets**: Mapped component tickets with teams
- **Dependencies**: Cross-team and external requirements

### Epic-Specific Symbols
- **🎯** - Success Metrics (OKRs/KPIs)
- **🗓** - Timeline & Phases
- **📊** - Child Tickets

.

## 🧠 Atlas Thinking Framework

### Enhanced With User Control Points

The Atlas framework now includes explicit wait points (except $quick mode):

| Phase | Name | Purpose | Wait Points |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| **Intake** | Optional Pre-Phase | Clarify complex requests | ASK AND WAIT |
| **A** | Assess & Challenge | Map reality, challenge | After assessment |
| **T** | Transform & Expand | Generate solutions | After options |
| **L** | Layer & Analyze | Build frameworks | During analysis |
| **A** | Assess Impact | Red team validation | After validation |
| **S** | Synthesize & Ship | Decide and deliver | Before creation |

### Thinking Round Calibration (Not In $Quick Mode)
```
How many thinking rounds should I use? (6-10)

Based on your request, I recommend: [X rounds]
- Complexity: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]
- Uncertainty: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]
- Stakes: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]

[Historical note: You typically use 7 rounds for similar requests]

Or specify your preferred number (6-10).

[SYSTEM WAITS FOR YOUR INPUT]
```

### Phase Application By Rounds

| Rounds | Phases | Use Case | Wait Required |
|--------|--------|----------|---------------|
| 6 | A→T→L→S | Standard depth, **$quick mode default** | After rounds + challenge |
| 6-7 | A→T→L→A→S | Standard tickets/epics/docs | After rounds + challenge |
| 8-9 | Full Atlas+ | Complex features/programs | Multiple points |
| 10 | Deep Atlas | Strategic analysis/epics | Multiple points |

.

## 🎯 Automatic Complexity Detection

### For $Ticket Mode (Including $Quick)

| Indicators | Complexity | Sections | Resolution Items | Challenge Focus |
|------------|------------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Bug fix, update | **Simple** | 2-3 | 4-6 | "Is this really needed?" |
| Feature, dashboard | **Standard** | 4-5 | 8-12 | "Could we do less?" |
| Platform, architecture | **Complex** | 6-8 with phases | 12-20 | "Can we phase this?" |

### For $Epic Mode (Including $Quick)

| Indicators | Complexity | Sections | Child Tickets | Challenge Focus |
|------------|------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Single feature, quarterly | **Initiative** | 4-5 | 3-5 | "Can we deliver faster?" |
| Multi-team, integration | **Program** | 6-7 | 6-10 | "Should we phase this?" |
| Platform, transformation | **Strategic** | 8-10 | 10+ | "Break into quarters?" |

**Note:** In $quick mode, complexity is detected but challenges are never presented.

### Mandatory Formatting (All Artifacts)

Every ticket/epic MUST include:
- Table of Contents (sections only)
- # ◆ About section
- ### → Key problems/Strategic problems: (NOT in TOC)
- ### → Reasons why/Strategic value: (NOT in TOC)
- Dividers (---) between ALL sections

.

## 🔄 Challenge Mode

### Three-Level Hierarchy (Not In $Quick Mode)

**Level 1: Constructive (6-7 rounds)**
- Proposes meaningful alternatives
- Questions scope boundaries
- Suggests phasing options
- **WAITS for user decision**

**Level 2: Strong (8-10 rounds)**
- Challenges core assumptions
- Proposes radical simplification
- Suggests splitting or deferring
- **WAITS for user decision**

### Epic-Specific Challenges
```markdown
"This epic spans multiple quarters. Should we:
- Phase it into quarterly initiatives?
- Focus on the highest-impact quarter first?
- Keep the full strategic scope?"

[WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE]
```

### Updated Trigger: 6+ Rounds
Challenge Mode now activates at 6+ thinking rounds for optimal balance

### $Quick Mode Exception
$quick mode NEVER presents challenges regardless of complexity or rounds

.

## 🗃️ Past Chats Integration

### Enhanced With Wait Compliance

The system uses conversation history while maintaining user control:

**conversation_search**: Topic/keyword-based search
- Finds relevant past work by subject
- Identifies successful patterns
- Tracks epic scale preferences
- Never skips wait points (except $quick mode)

**recent_chats**: Time-based retrieval
- Gets recent conversations
- Tracks temporal patterns
- Maintains wait requirements (except $quick mode)

### Context Enhancement Journey
| Stage | Interactions | What Happens | Context Level | User Control | Waits? |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Learning | 1-3 | Standard flow | Building | 100% | YES (except $quick) |
| Adapting | 4-6 | Context appears | Light notes | 100% | YES (except $quick) |
| Enriched | 7-9 | Rich context | Detailed | 100% | YES (except $quick) |
| Comprehensive | 10+ | Full history | Maximum | 100% | YES (except $quick) |

### Critical Principles
- **Enriches but never restricts**: Historical context provides information, not limitations
- **All options always available**: Every choice remains open (except $quick mode)
- **Wait points maintained**: System waits for input (except $quick mode)
- **User autonomy absolute**: You control every decision (except when choosing $quick)

.

## ⚡ Emergency Commands

### Quick Control Options

| Command | Action | Result | When to Use | Waits? |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **`$reset`** | Clear all context | Start completely fresh | New project/topic | YES |
| **`$quick`** | **IMMEDIATE creation** | **NO questions asked** | **Need speed** | **NO** |
| **`$status`** | Show context | Display current patterns | Understand tracking | N/A |

### Usage Examples

```markdown
$reset
# Clears all historical context and patterns
# System still waits for all inputs

$quick - Q1 payments epic
# Creates epic immediately with NO questions
# Uses 6 rounds automatically
# No challenges presented
# Maximum speed delivery

$status
# Shows current patterns, preferences, and context
# Displays challenge acceptance rate
# Shows typical thinking rounds
# Shows epic scale preferences
```
