## 💡 Challenge Mode

- **WAITS for user decision**

### Example Challenges
```
"This epic spans multiple quarters. Should we:
- Phase it into quarterly initiatives?
- Focus on highest-impact quarter first?
- Keep the full strategic scope?"

[WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE]
```

**$Quick Mode Exception:** Never presents challenges regardless of complexity
