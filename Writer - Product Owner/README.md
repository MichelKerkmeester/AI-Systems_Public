## 🎛️ Operating Modes

| Mode | Command | Purpose | Output | Interactive | Challenge |
|------|---------|---------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Discovery** | DEFAULT | Figure out what to create | Varies | Yes | 3+ rounds |
| **Ticket** | `$ticket` | Development tickets | Auto-scales 2-8 sections | Yes | 3+ rounds |
| **Spec** | `$spec` | Frontend implementations | Code blocks | Yes | 3+ rounds |

| **Text** | `$text` | Quick snippets | Artifact always | Minimal | Rarely |
| **Beautify** | `$beautify` | Format documents | Clean structure | Yes | 2+ rounds |

### Discovery Flow with Historical Context
When no mode is specified, the system searches past conversations and helps determine what to create:

```
[Searching conversation history for context...]

Welcome! Let's figure out what you need. 🤔

[Historical note: You've created 3 tickets and 2 specs recently]

What would you like to create?
1. Development ticket - Feature or bug for developers
2. Implementation spec - Frontend code/styling solution
3. Product documentation - User guide or feature docs
4. Text snippet - Quick description or copy
5. Document formatting - Clean up and organize existing text

Which best fits? (1-5)
```

### Direct Mode Activation
Use $ prefix to skip discovery:
- `$ticket` → Straight to ticket questions
- `$spec` → Straight to implementation questions
- `$doc` → Straight to documentation questions
- `$text` → Minimal questions for quick content
- `$beautify` → Document formatting mode

.

## ⚡ Emergency Commands

### Quick Recovery Options

| Command | Action | Result | Past Chats Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| **`$reset`** | Clear all context | Start completely fresh | Stops history search |
| **`$standard`** | Default flow | Ignore all patterns | No historical context |
| **`$quick`** | Fast creation | Skip discovery phase | Minimal history use |
| **`$status`** | Show context | Display current patterns | Shows all tracking |

### Usage Examples

```markdown
$reset
# Clears all historical context and patterns
# Perfect for starting new projects

$status
# Shows current patterns, preferences, and context
# Helps understand what's being tracked

$standard
# Uses default flow without any historical influence
# Good when you want unbiased process

$quick - Need auth ticket
# Skips to creation but still asks thinking rounds
# Minimal pattern checking for speed
```

### Command Combinations
```markdown
$reset then $quick      # Fresh start + fast creation
$status then $standard  # Check patterns then ignore them
```

.

## 🗃️ Past Chats Integration

### How It Works
The system uses two tools to search conversation history:

**conversation_search**: Topic/keyword-based search
- Finds relevant past work by subject
- Identifies successful patterns
- Locates similar challenges

**recent_chats**: Time-based retrieval
- Gets recent conversations
- Tracks temporal patterns
- Maintains session continuity

### Context Display Example
```markdown
[Searching past conversations about authentication...]

Found relevant context from 3 previous conversations:
- Auth ticket created last week (7 rounds, custom implementation)
- Security requirements discussed Tuesday
- Compliance needs from project kickoff

Historical Context (informative only):
- You typically use Standard complexity for auth features
- Average thinking rounds: 4
- Challenge acceptance: 70%

All options remain available.
```

### Critical Principles
- **Enriches but never restricts**: Historical context provides information, not limitations
- **All options always available**: Every choice remains open regardless of patterns
- **User autonomy absolute**: You can always override any suggestion
- **Emergency commands available**: $reset clears all history instantly

.

## 🎯 Automatic Complexity Detection

### For $ticket Mode with Historical Context

The system detects complexity based on keywords and past patterns:

| Indicators | Complexity | Sections | Resolution Items | Historical Note |
|------------|------------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Bug fix, update | **Simple** | 2-3 | 4-6 | [You typically use Simple for bugs] |
| Feature, dashboard | **Standard** | 4-5 | 8-12 | [Most common in your history] |
| Platform, architecture | **Complex** | 6-8 with phases | 12-20 | [You prefer phased delivery] |

### Mandatory Formatting (ALL Tickets)

Every ticket MUST include:

```markdown
• Table of Contents (sections only)
• # ◆ About section
• ### → Key problems: (NOT in TOC)
• ### → Reasons why: (NOT in TOC)
• ## ◳ Designs & References
• ## ✓ Resolution Checklist with QA warning
• Dividers (---) between ALL sections
```

.

## 💻 Implementation Specs ($spec)

### Pattern Detection with History

**Quick Patterns (1-2 questions):**
- CSS utilities, simple components
- Animations, layouts

**Standard Patterns (2-3 questions):**
- Data tables, forms, modals
- State management

**Complex Patterns (3-4 questions):**
- Performance optimization
- Real-time features
- Accessibility compliance

### Example Flow
```
User: $spec infinite scroll

System: [Checking past component specs...]

Let's build your infinite scroll implementation! 🔧

[Historical: You prefer React with minimal dependencies]

How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-10)
Based on your request, I recommend: 2-3 rounds

User: 2

Quick setup:
1. **Framework?** (React/Vue/Vanilla) [Default: React based on history]
2. **Data source?** (API/Local)

[Generates complete, optimized implementation as artifact]
```

.

## 📚 Documentation ($doc)

### Depth-Based Structure

**Three Depth Levels:**
1. **Overview** - High-level, 1-2 paragraphs per feature
2. **Detailed** - Step-by-step, 3-4 paragraphs
3. **Comprehensive** - All details, tips, workflows

### Documentation Symbol Usage
- **◇** - Feature sections
- **◊** - Sub-headings (bold)
- **→** - References
- **⌆** - Additional resources

### Historical Context
The system remembers your documentation preferences:
- Typical depth level
- Audience focus (developers/users/mixed)
- Structure preferences

.

## ✍️ Text Snippets ($text)

### Quick Content Generation

Perfect for:
- Component descriptions
- Error messages
- Marketing copy
- UX writing
- Email templates

### Minimal Process with Pattern Recognition
```
User: $text error message for payment failure

System: [Quick check: You prefer clear, non-technical messages]

Let's write your error message! ✍️

How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-2 typical for snippets)

User: 1

Quick context - is this for:
- Customer-facing UI
- Internal logging

User: Customer-facing UI

[Creates artifact with error message matching your style]
```

.

## 📗 Platform Integration

### After Every Creation
```markdown
📦 **Add to your workspace?**

1. **ClickUp** - Task management, sprints
2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only

[Historical: You typically choose ClickUp (80%)]
Which option? (1 or 2)
```

### Pattern Learning
- Tracks your platform preferences by mode
- Learns when you prefer ClickUp vs artifact-only
- Adapts suggestions based on history

.

## 🧠 ATLAS Thinking Framework

### Enhanced with Conversation History

The ATLAS framework now searches past conversations to:
- Find similar problems and solutions
- Identify successful patterns
- Avoid past failures
- Calibrate challenge intensity

### The Five Phases

| Phase | Name | Purpose | History Integration |
|-------|------|---------|-------------------|
| **A** | Assess & Challenge | Map reality, challenge | Searches similar problems |
| **T** | Transform & Expand | Generate solutions | Finds successful patterns |
| **L** | Layer & Analyze | Build frameworks | Checks past failures |
| **A** | Assess Impact | Red team | Uses validation patterns |
| **S** | Synthesize & Ship | Decide and deliver | Applies past successes |

### Thinking Round Calibration with Context

```
How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-10)

Based on your request, I recommend: [X rounds]
- Complexity: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]
- Uncertainty: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]
- Stakes: [Low/Medium/High] - [reason]

[Historical note: You typically use 4 rounds for similar requests]

Or specify your preferred number (all options available).
```

.

## 💡 Challenge Mode

### Calibrated by History

Challenge intensity adapts based on your past acceptance rate:
- **>70% acceptance**: Strong challenges (you appreciate them)
- **<30% acceptance**: Gentle challenges (minimal disruption)
- **30-70%**: Constructive balance

### Challenge Triggers
- **Standard**: Activates at 3+ thinking rounds
- **Beautify**: Activates at 2+ thinking rounds (lower threshold)

### Examples with Context
```markdown
[Historical: You've accepted simplification 8 of 10 times]

"Let's go lean here - could we ship just the search feature
instead of the full dashboard? I know you appreciate getting 
value out quickly."
```

.

## 🚨 REPAIR Error Recovery

### Enhanced with Historical Learning

The REPAIR framework now:
- Checks if errors occurred before
- References past solutions
- Prevents recurring issues
- Learns from failures

### Example Recovery
```markdown
R: Detected scope creep
   [History: This happened 3 times before]
E: Timeline expanded 3× from original
P: Three options:
   1. Full scope (12 weeks)
   2. Original only (4 weeks)
   3. Phased (4 weeks/phase) ← Your successful pattern
A: [Based on choice and history]
I: Implement selected
R: Pattern updated for prevention
```

.
