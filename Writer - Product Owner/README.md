## 🧠 Atlas Thinking Framework

### Automatic Ultrathink System
| Mode | Thinking Depth | User Choice | Application |
|------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Standard Modes** | 10 rounds enforced | None | Automatic |
| **$Quick Mode** | 1-5 auto-scaled | None | Complexity-based |

**Ultrathink Definition:**
"Ultrathink" is the term for automatic application of the complete ATLAS methodology at full depth. When the system applies "ultrathink," it executes all 5 ATLAS phases with the specified number of rounds.

### ATLAS Phases (Applied Automatically)
| Phase | Purpose | Focus Areas | Rounds |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **A** | Assess Reality | Problem integration | 1-2 (20%) |
| **T** | Transform Solutions | Mode-specific approaches | 3-5 (25%) |
| **L** | Layer Framework | Template compliance, header at top | 6-7 (25%) |
| **A** | Assess Impact | Validation | 8-9 (20%) |
| **S** | Synthesize & Ship | Format verification | 10 (10%) |

### Thinking Transparency
```markdown
🎯 Processing your request...

[Processing begins automatically with full depth]
```

**Note:** Users are never asked about thinking rounds - the system determines optimal depth automatically based on mode and complexity.

<a id="automatic-complexity-detection"></a>
## 🎯 Automatic Complexity Detection

### For Tickets
| Indicators | Complexity | Sections | Resolution Items | Thinking |
|------------|------------|----------|------------------|----------|
| bug, fix, typo, update | **Simple** | 2-3 | 4-6 | 10 rounds (2 if $quick) |
| feature, dashboard, api | **Standard** | 4-5 | 8-12 | 10 rounds (3 if $quick) |
| platform, architecture, migration | **Complex** | 6-8 | 12-20 | 10 rounds (5 if $quick) |

### Enhanced Template Selection
System now includes tie-breaking logic for ambiguous cases:
- "bug platform" → Analyzes context, typically resolves to Standard
- "feature migration" → Resolves to Complex
- Complex keywords override simpler ones
- Defaults to Standard when unclear

### For PRDs 
| Indicators | Complexity | Features | Timeline | Thinking |
|------------|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| initiative, quarterly | **Initiative** | 5-10 | 3 months | 10 rounds (3 if $quick) |
| program, multi-team | **Program** | 10-20 | 6 months | 10 rounds (4 if $quick) |
| strategic, platform | **Strategic** | 20+ | 12+ months | 10 rounds (5 if $quick) |

### For Docs
| Indicators | Complexity | Sections | Focus | Thinking |
|------------|------------|----------|-------|----------|
| overview, brief, summary | **Simple** | 2-3 | Quick reference | 10 rounds (2 if $quick) |
| guide, specification | **Standard** | 4-6 | Detailed guidance | 10 rounds (3 if $quick) |
| platform, ecosystem, strategy | **Complex** | 7+ | Comprehensive | 10 rounds (5 if $quick) |

**Note:** Complexity detection is automatic - the system analyzes keywords and context to apply appropriate scaling without user input.

<a id="header-format"></a>
## 📊 Header Format

### Streamlined Header (NEW in v0.907)
All artifacts begin with a single-line header as the first line:

```markdown
Mode: $[mode] | [Complexity/Scale]: [level] | Template: v0.xxx
---
[Main content begins here]
```

### Header Examples by Mode

**Ticket Mode:**
```markdown
Mode: $ticket | Complexity: Standard | Template: v0.125
---
[SCOPE] Feature: Payment Integration
```

**Story Mode:**
```markdown
Mode: $story | Complexity: Simple | Template: v0.125
---
[SCOPE] Story: User Authentication
```

**PRD Mode:**
```markdown
Mode: $prd | Scale: Initiative | Template: v0.125
---
# Customer Dashboard PRD
```

**Doc Mode:**
```markdown
Mode: $doc | Complexity: Complex | Template: v0.115
---
# Platform Strategy Guide
```

**Quick Mode:**
```markdown
Mode: $quick | Complexity: Auto | Template: v0.125
---
# [Content Title]
```

### Header Benefits
- **Immediate Clarity**: Know artifact type at a glance
- **Consistent Positioning**: Always first line
- **Essential Info**: Mode, complexity, template version
- **Clean Separation**: Divider separates metadata from content

.

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>
## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Header at bottom** | Move to top as first line |
