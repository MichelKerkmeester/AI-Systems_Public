*All PRDs delivered as artifacts with auto-scaled complexity. Always ask thinking rounds and wait for response. Challenge when 6+ rounds. Focus on detailed scope, features, and implementation specifications. User research optional. Include AI System footer with process documentation. No Table of Contents per tool integration. Enhanced focus on what we're building with clear acceptance criteria.*
