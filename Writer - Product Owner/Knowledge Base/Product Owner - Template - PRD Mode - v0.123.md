# ‚ñ† Technical Requirements

## ‚óªÔ∏è Architecture

**System Architecture Overview**

The technical implementation leverages a microservices architecture with event-driven 
communication patterns. Services are containerized and orchestrated using Kubernetes, 
with horizontal scaling based on load metrics. The system maintains backward 
compatibility through API versioning and feature flags.

Services Affected: [List of existing microservices requiring updates]
New Services: [Services to be created with their responsibilities]
Database Changes: [Schema modifications with migration strategies]
API Changes: [Endpoints added/modified with versioning approach]

## ‚óªÔ∏è Integration Points

| System | Integration Type | Data Flow | Criticality |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| External API | REST/GraphQL | Bidirectional | High |
| Internal Service | Event-driven | Publish | Medium |
| Third-party | Webhook | Subscribe | Low |

## ‚óªÔ∏è Performance Requirements

**Response Time Targets**

| Operation | Target | Maximum | Measurement Point |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Page Load | <2s | 3s | First meaningful paint |
| API Response | <200ms | 500ms | Server response time |
| Search | <100ms | 200ms | Results display |

The system must maintain these performance characteristics under expected load 
conditions while gracefully degrading under peak traffic. Caching strategies 
include CDN for static assets, Redis for session data, and database query 
optimization for frequently accessed data.

interviews to understand pain points and validate our solution approach. The 
research phase included multiple rounds of prototype testing with iterative 
refinements based on user feedback.

**Research Conducted**

Method: In-depth interviews with 25 target users, supplemented by survey data 
from 500+ respondents and analysis of existing usage patterns.

Key Finding: Users struggle with [specific pain point], leading to [measurable 
impact] on their workflow efficiency.

Impact on Design: This insight led us to prioritize [specific feature] and 
simplify [specific workflow] to reduce cognitive load.

# ‚ñ† Implementation Plan

## ‚óªÔ∏è Development Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**

This phase establishes the core infrastructure and fundamental features that 
subsequent phases will build upon. Focus is on architectural soundness and 
establishing patterns that will scale.

Deliverables include core feature implementation, basic analytics integration, 
and foundational API endpoints. The team will establish coding standards, 
testing frameworks, and CI/CD pipelines during this phase.

Exit Criteria:
- All core features functional with unit test coverage >80%
- Automated deployment pipeline operational
- Security review completed with no critical findings

**Phase 2: Enhancement (Weeks 5-8)**

Building on the foundation, this phase adds sophisticated functionality and 
begins optimization work. User feedback from Phase 1 beta testing informs 
priority adjustments.

Deliverables include enhanced features, performance optimizations, and 
expanded platform support. Integration testing becomes the focus, ensuring 
all components work seamlessly together.

## ‚óªÔ∏è Testing Strategy

**Comprehensive Test Coverage**

| Test Type | Coverage Target | Responsibility | Tools |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| Unit | >80% | Engineering | Jest/Mocha |
| Integration | Critical paths | QA | Selenium |
| E2E | User journeys | QA | Cypress |
| Performance | All endpoints | DevOps | K6/JMeter |

Testing philosophy emphasizes shift-left practices with developers writing 
tests alongside code. Automated testing gates prevent regression, while 
manual exploratory testing discovers edge cases.

# ‚ñ† Feature Specification

## ‚óªÔ∏è Functional Requirements

**Core Functionality**

The feature operates through a series of user interactions and system responses 
designed to deliver value efficiently. Each interaction has been carefully 
considered to minimize cognitive load while maximizing utility.

1. **Primary Function**
   
   User Action: [Detailed description of what the user does]
   
   System Response: [Complete explanation of system behavior]
   
   Result: [Clear outcome and value delivered to user]
   
   Data Operations: [What gets created, read, updated, or deleted]

## ‚óªÔ∏è User Interface

**Component Architecture**

The interface consists of modular components that work together to create a 
cohesive user experience. Each component has defined responsibilities and 
clear interaction patterns.

Components include [Component 1] which handles [specific responsibility], 
[Component 2] managing [another responsibility], and [Component 3] providing 
[additional functionality]. These components communicate through well-defined 
interfaces and maintain separation of concerns.

## ‚óªÔ∏è Business Logic

**Validation and Processing Rules**

The system enforces business rules through multiple layers of validation, 
ensuring data integrity and consistent user experience. Rules are applied 
both client-side for immediate feedback and server-side for security.

Validation includes format checking, business constraint enforcement, and 
cross-field dependencies. Each validation failure provides clear, actionable 
error messages guiding users toward successful completion.
