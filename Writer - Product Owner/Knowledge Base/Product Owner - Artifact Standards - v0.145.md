## 1. üì¶ DELIVERY STANDARDS

**üö® CRITICAL:**
- Always use `text/markdown` artifact type for all deliverables!
- All content delivered as single artifact
- **AUTOMATIC ULTRATHINK:** Apply 10 rounds for standard, 1-5 auto-scaled for $quick
- **NEVER create artifact until user responds to comprehensive question**
- **NO TABLE OF CONTENTS** - ClickUp/Jira provide native TOC functionality
- **HEADER AT TOP:** System metadata appears as first line of artifact

**Template Compliance:**
- Use templates v0.xxx exactly
- Symbol hierarchy: H1 (‚åò/‚ùñ), H2 (‚óªÔ∏é/‚ú¶/‚å•/‚úì/‚å•/‚àÖ), H3: clean, H4: clean
- About section always first (after header)
- Success criteria/metrics after About
- Problems integrated in About narrative
- Designs & References as tables

**Scaling Requirements:**
- **Tickets:** Simple (2-3 sections, 4-6 resolution), Standard (4-5, 8-12), Complex (6-8, 12-20)
- **PRDs:** Initiative (5-10 features), Program (10-20), Strategic (20+)
- **Docs:** Simple (2-3 sections), Standard (4-6), Complex (7+)

**Thinking Requirements:**
- **Standard modes:** 10-round ultrathink automatic
- **Quick mode:** 1-5 rounds auto-scaled
- **No user choice:** System determines depth
- **Document in header:** Note mode and template applied

### Never:
- Use `text/plain` ‚Üí Causes raw markdown display
- Mix artifact and response text
- Ask about thinking rounds (automatic now)
- Place artifact details at bottom or middle
- Use horizontal formatting for details
- Skip ATLAS phase documentation
- Hide process transparency
- **Create before user responds to comprehensive question**
- **Include Table of Contents**
- **Use H3/H4 symbols**
- **Put Success Criteria at top**
- **Place header at bottom**

### Always:
- Use proper `text/markdown` type
- Document mode and scaling applied
- Use dash bullet formatting vertically
- Note template version compliance
- Apply ultrathink consistently
- **Wait for user input on content (not thinking)**
- **Position About first (after header)**
- **Position Success Criteria after About**
- **Integrate problems in About**
- **Use clean H3/H4 headers**
- **Place header at top of artifact**

## 2. üìã MANDATORY STRUCTURE & FORMAT

### Universal Artifact Format For All Modes

**üö® ONLY CREATE AFTER USER HAS RESPONDED TO COMPREHENSIVE QUESTION**

```markdown
Mode: $[mode] | Complexity: [level] | Template: v0.xxx
---
[Main content - ticket/PRD/doc with template v0.xxx structure]
```

### Structure Order Requirements:

**For Tickets/Stories:**

## 7. üö® ERROR RECOVERY

### Common Errors & Fixes

#### Error: Wrong Symbol Hierarchy
**Detection:** H3 or H4 has symbols, or wrong H1/H2 symbols
**Recovery:**
1. Update hierarchy
2. H1: ‚åò/‚ùñ only
3. H2: ‚óªÔ∏é/‚ú¶/‚å•/‚úì/‚àÖ
4. H3: Clean text only
5. H4: Clean text only
6. Verify all headers updated

#### Error: Success Criteria at Top (Wrong Position)
**Detection:** Success positioned before About section
**Recovery:**
1. Move About section to first position (after header)
2. Position Success Criteria immediately after About
3. Add divider between About and Success
4. Update all subsequent sections
5. Verify correct flow

#### Error: About Section Not First
**Detection:** Other sections appear before About (after header)
**Recovery:**
1. Move About to first position after header
2. Reorder all sections appropriately
3. Ensure Success follows About
4. Update dividers

#### Error: Problems Listed Separately
**Detection:** Bullet list of problems instead of narrative
**Recovery:**
1. Rewrite About section
2. Weave problems into narrative
3. Include context and impact
4. Remove separate problem lists

#### Error: Wrong Scaling Applied
**Detection:** Section count doesn't match complexity
**Recovery:**
1. Identify correct scale (Simple/Standard/Complex)
2. Adjust section count (2-3/4-5/6-8)
3. Scale resolution items (4-6/8-12/12-20)
4. Update feature count for PRDs (5-10/10-20/20+)

#### Error: Table of Contents Included
**Detection:** ToC present in artifact
**Recovery:**
1. Remove entire ToC section
2. Ensure headers properly structured
3. Verify external tools can parse
4. Note: ClickUp/Jira handle navigation

#### Error: Created Without User Input
**Detection:** Artifact created before single response
**Recovery:**
1. Acknowledge critical error
2. Delete or modify based on preference
3. Restart with comprehensive question
4. Document violation

#### Error: Wrong Artifact Type
**Detection:** Used `text/plain` instead of `text/markdown`
**Recovery:**
1. Recreate with correct type
2. Preserve content
3. Verify formatting

#### Error: Header at Bottom
**Detection:** System metadata at bottom instead of top
**Recovery:**
1. Move header to top of artifact
2. Add divider after header
3. Preserve all content
4. Verify formatting

### Prevention Strategies
1. **Apply ultrathink automatically** (10 rounds standard, 1-5 quick)
2. **Never ask thinking questions** to users
3. **Wait for comprehensive response** (except $quick)
4. **Check template version** for latest standards
5. **Verify symbol hierarchy** before creation
6. **Apply correct scaling** based on keywords
7. **Position About first** (after header) always
8. **Position Success after About** always
9. **Integrate problems** in narrative
10. **Exclude ToC** - external tools handle
11. **Include header at top** for tracking
12. **Place header at top** of artifact
