## 1. üé´ TICKET MODE OVERVIEW

### Command: `$ticket` or `$story`

- **Purpose:** Create development tickets or user stories that auto-scale complexity
- **Output:** Always as artifact
- **Thinking:** 10 rounds automatic (ultrathink), 1-5 auto-scaled for $quick
- **Interactive Mode:** Asks ticket vs story, Figma MCP connection
- **Key Difference:** Stories omit Resolution Checklist

- Story = User story format without checklist

[WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE]

User: ticket

System: **Question 2: Can I connect to Figma MCP to inspect your designs?**
- Yes = I'll pull design details directly
- No = I'll add placeholders for you to fill

[WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE]

User: no

System: **Question 3: What's the scope?** (BE/FE/Mobile/FS/DevOps/QA)

[WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE]

User: BE

System: Creating your backend payment integration ticket...
- 10-round ultrathink applied automatically
- Success criteria positioned after About section
