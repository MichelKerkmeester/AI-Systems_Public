## 1. üé´ TICKET MODE OVERVIEW

### Command: `$ticket`

- **Purpose:** Create development tickets with QA checklists that auto-scale complexity
- **Output:** Always as `text/markdown` artifact
- **Thinking:** 10 rounds automatic (DEPTH methodology), 1-5 auto-scaled for $quick
- **Interactive Mode:** Single comprehensive question gathering ALL requirements
- **Header Position:** Always at top as first line
- **Output Constraints:** Ticket contains ONLY the requested feature/fix/change
- **Key Feature:** Includes Resolution Checklist for QA verification

### Critical Rules
- **NEVER create artifact until user responds to comprehensive question**
- **NEVER answer own questions - always wait for user response**
- **NO TABLE OF CONTENTS** - ClickUp/Jira provide native TOC functionality
- **HEADER AT TOP:** System metadata appears as first line of artifact

### Note on User Stories
For user story format (narrative without QA checklists), use `$story` command which references **Product Owner - Template - Story Mode - v0.132.md**

---

## 2. üì¶ DELIVERY STANDARDS

### Universal Requirements
- **Artifact Type:** Always use `text/markdown` (never `text/plain`)
- **Single Artifact:** All content delivered as one artifact
- **DEPTH Processing:** 
  - Standard modes: 10 rounds automatic (not user choice)
  - Quick mode: 1-5 rounds auto-scaled based on complexity
- **Wait for Input:** NEVER proceed without user response to questions
- **Template Compliance:** Use v0.140 structure exactly

### Ticket-Specific Standards
- **Scaling:** 
  - Simple: 2-3 sections, 4-6 resolution items
  - Standard: 4-5 sections, 8-12 items
  - Complex: 6-8 sections, 12-20 items
- **Output Focus:** ONLY deliver what user requested
- **No Scope Expansion:** Template scaling affects structure, not content scope
- **Multiple Perspectives:** All analyze the SAME requirement
- **Convergent Output:** Many approaches considered, ONE delivered
- **Resolution Checklist:** Mandatory for all ticket templates

### Mandatory Structure Elements

#### Symbol Hierarchy
- **H1:** ‚åò (About), ‚ùñ (Main sections)
- **H2:** ‚óª (Subsections), ‚ú¶ (Success), ‚å• (Designs), ‚úì (Checklist), ‚àÖ (Risks)
- **H3:** Clean headers (no symbols)
- **H4:** Clean headers (no symbols)

#### Structure Order
1. Header (Mode | Complexity | Template) - FIRST LINE
2. Title with [SCOPE]
3. About (‚åò) - Context with integrated problems
4. Success Criteria (‚ú¶) - After About
5. Designs & References (‚å•) - Numbered list format
6. Requirements (‚ùñ) - Specifications
7. Risks (‚àÖ) - Complex tickets when criteria met
8. Resolution Checklist (‚úì) - Tickets only

#### Formatting Standards
- **Dividers:** Use `---` between header and content, between all sections
- **Lists:** Always use `-` for bullets, `[]` for checkboxes
- **Designs & References:** Numbered list with bulleted items (no tables)
- **Links:** Use `[Link - to be added]` for placeholders
- **Status Notes:** Format as `[Status note: "description"]`
- **Problems:** Integrated in About narrative, never listed separately

### Visual Hierarchy Rules
- One blank line before divider
- One blank line after divider
- Exception: No blank line after final divider
- Consistent spacing throughout
- Clean H3/H4 headers without symbols
- Use `---` as major section separators

### Content Integration
- Context and purpose integrated in About
- No separate problem lists
- Clear narrative flow throughout
- Documentation covers ONLY requested feature

### Ticket Focus Areas

**Bug Fixes:**
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Fix implementation
- Testing requirements

**Feature Development:**
- User requirements [only requested features]
- Technical specifications [for requested system]
- Acceptance criteria [relevant to request]
- Success metrics [of requested functionality]

**Platform Changes:**
- Migration strategy [for requested platform]
- Risk assessment [within scope]
- Rollback plans [for requested changes]
- Performance targets [as requested]

## 3. üìè COMPLEXITY AUTO-SCALING

|| Keywords | Complexity | Sections | Resolution Items | DEPTH Processing |
||----------|------------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
|| bug, fix, typo, update | Simple | 2-3 | 4-6 | 10 rounds (1-2 if $quick) |
|| feature, dashboard, interface | Standard | 4-5 | 8-12 | 10 rounds (3 if $quick) |
|| platform, migration, system | Complex | 6-8 | 12-20 | 10 rounds (5 if $quick) |

**Important:** Complexity determines TEMPLATE SIZE, not content scope
- User requests "bug fix" ‚Üí Simple template for THAT bug only
- NOT: Simple template with multiple bugs or extra fixes

### DEPTH Processing Standards
- **Multiple perspectives:** All analyze SAME requirement
- **Single output:** One ticket covering exact request
- **No scope expansion:** Complexity affects template size, not feature count

---

## 10. ‚ö° QUICK MODE TEMPLATES

### Quick Mode Rules
- **NO questions asked** - System proceeds immediately
- **Auto-detection** - Complexity determined from keywords
- **1-5 round scaling** - Based on detected complexity
- **Minimal format** - Essential sections only
- **Same scope discipline** - Only requested content
- **Resolution Checklist Required** - Even in quick mode

### $quick ticket
```markdown
Mode: $quick | Complexity: Auto-scaled | Template: v0.132
---
[FIX] {feature}: {issue}

# ‚åò About
**Problem:** {what users experience}  
**Solution:** {how to fix}  

## ‚úì Quick Checklist
[] Implement fix
[] Test locally
[] Deploy staging
[] Verify prod
```

---

## üìö INTEGRATION NOTES

### Ticket vs Story Differences

**Tickets Have:**
- Resolution Checklist with QA verification steps
- Detailed implementation tracking
- PR/deployment checklist items
- Technical focus throughout

**For User Stories:**
- Use `$story` command instead
- References **Product Owner - Template - Story Mode - v0.132.md**
- No Resolution Checklist
- User journey focus
- "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]" format

### When to Use Tickets vs Stories

**Use Tickets When:**
- Detailed implementation tracking needed
- QA checklist required
- Step-by-step resolution needed
- Engineering-focused delivery

**Use Stories When:**
- Emphasizing user perspective and journey
- Communicating with stakeholders
- Defining user value and acceptance criteria
- Planning from user needs

---

## üéØ FINAL REMINDERS

1. **Always wait** for user response (except $quick)
2. **Never answer** own questions
3. **Resolution Checklist Required** for all tickets (key differentiator from stories)
4. **Header at top** as first line
5. **No Table of Contents**
6. **Only requested features** - no scope expansion
7. **DEPTH methodology** applied automatically (10 rounds standard, 1-5 quick)
8. **For user stories** - use `$story` command which uses separate Story Mode template
