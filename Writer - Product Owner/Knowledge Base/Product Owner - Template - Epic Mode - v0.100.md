## 1. 🚀 EPIC MODE OVERVIEW

### Command: `$epic`

* **Purpose:** Create detailed feature specifications with implementation details across apps
* **Output:** Always as artifact with hierarchical feature breakdown
* **Thinking Rounds:** 8-10 (detail requires analysis)
* **Feature Depth:** UI/UX specifications, flows, technical requirements
* **Format:** Nested structure with specific implementation details

---

## 2. 📈 COMPLEXITY AUTO-SCALING

| Complexity        | Detail Level         | Features       | Documentation | Design Status |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Standard**      | Component-level      | 5-10 features  | 3-5 docs      | Some TBD      |
| **Detailed**      | Implementation-level | 10-20 features | 6-10 docs     | Mixed states  |
| **Comprehensive** | Specification-level  | 20+ features   | 10+ docs      | Full coverage |

---

## 3. 🧩 DETAILED EPIC TEMPLATE

* **What it is:** A complete cross-app epic blueprint with UI/UX, flows, dependencies, and implementation notes.
* **When to use:** Multi-feature initiatives spanning Creator/Partner apps, or any effort needing end-to-end breakdown.
* **Best practices — Do:** Keep scope tight, number features, call out status/dependencies, add success metrics.
* **Best practices — Don’t:** Mix unrelated initiatives, hide blockers, or omit owner/risks.

## 4. 📐 FEATURE SPECIFICATION TEMPLATE

* **What it is:** A single-feature implementation spec with flows, UI components, data, APIs, and tests.
* **When to use:** Building or refining one feature; design/engineering handoff; QA planning.
* **Best practices — Do:** Document edge cases, accessibility, analytics, and performance budgets.
* **Best practices — Don’t:** Skip error states, mix multiple features, or leave API responses vague.

## 5. 🧭 TRANSFORMATION EPIC TEMPLATE

* **What it is:** A vision-to-execution epic that reimagines a system and phases delivery (P1→P3).
* **When to use:** Platform shifts, architecture changes, major strategic bets with multi-team impact.
* **Best practices — Do:** Require platform prerequisites, define phases, and link analytics baselines.
* **Best practices — Don’t:** Start delivery without enabling capabilities or clear success metrics.

[Vision statement that completely reimagines the product/platform]

We've built a [system type] that [primary value], [secondary value], and [business outcome] all at the same time.

Think of it as a [multiple-win scenario]:
- **[User Type 1]** [specific detailed benefit]
- **[User Type 2]** [specific detailed benefit]
- **Business** [strategic outcome]

Every single feature in this [system] serves [multiple] purposes.
This isn't just a [traditional view]. It's a [revolutionary outcome] that happens to be an [amazing experience].
