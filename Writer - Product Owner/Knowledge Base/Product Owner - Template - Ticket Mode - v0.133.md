## 1. üé´ TICKET MODE OVERVIEW

### Command: `$ticket`

- **Purpose:** Create development tickets with QA checklists that auto-scale complexity
- **Output:** Always as `text/markdown` artifact
- **Thinking:** 10 rounds automatic (DEPTH methodology), 1-5 auto-scaled for $quick
- **Interactive Mode:** Handled by Interactive Mode v0.306 file (all question logic lives there)
- **Header Position:** Always at top as first line
- **Output Constraints:** Ticket contains ONLY the requested feature/fix/change
- **Key Feature:** Includes Resolution Checklist for QA verification

### Critical Rules
- **NEVER create artifact until user responds to comprehensive question**
- **NEVER answer own questions - always wait for user response**
- **NO TABLE OF CONTENTS** - ClickUp/Jira provide native TOC functionality
- **HEADER AT TOP:** System metadata appears as first line of artifact
- **INTERACTIVE QUESTIONS:** All question logic is in Interactive Mode v0.306 (not duplicated here)

### Note on User Stories
For user story format (narrative without QA checklists), use `$story` command which references **Product Owner - Template - Story Mode - v0.133.md**

---

## 2. üì¶ DELIVERY STANDARDS

### Universal Requirements
- **Artifact Type:** Always use `text/markdown` (never `text/plain`)
- **Single Artifact:** All content delivered as one artifact
- **DEPTH Processing:** 
  - Standard modes: 10 rounds automatic (not user choice)
  - Quick mode: 1-5 rounds auto-scaled based on complexity
- **Wait for Input:** NEVER proceed without user response to questions
- **Template Compliance:** Use v0.133 structure exactly

### Ticket-Specific Standards
- **Scaling:** 
  - Simple: 2-3 sections, 4-6 resolution items
  - Standard: 4-5 sections, 8-12 items
  - Complex: 6-8 sections, 12-20 items
- **Output Focus:** ONLY deliver what user requested
- **No Scope Expansion:** Template scaling affects structure, not content scope
- **Multiple Perspectives:** All analyze the SAME requirement
- **Convergent Output:** Many approaches considered, ONE delivered
- **Resolution Checklist:** Mandatory for all ticket templates

### Mandatory Structure Elements

#### Symbol Hierarchy
- **H1:** ‚åò (About), ‚ùñ (Requirements), ‚úì (Resolution Checklist)
- **H2:** ‚ú¶ (Success), ‚å• (Designs)
- **H3:** Clean headers (no symbols)
- **H4:** Clean headers (no symbols)

#### Structure Order
1. Header (Mode | Complexity | Template) - FIRST LINE
2. About (‚åò) - Context narrative
3. Short description (2-3 sentences) - WHAT was built/changed and WHY
4. Features (optional) - Bulleted list when applicable
5. User Need (numbered) - What problem this solves
6. Business Value (numbered) - Why it matters to business
7. Success Criteria (‚ú¶) - After Business Value
8. Designs & References (‚å•) - Bulleted list format
9. Requirements (‚ùñ) - Specifications with H3/H4 subsections
10. Resolution Checklist (‚úì) - QA verification items

#### Formatting Standards
- **Dividers:** Use `---` between all major sections (not between description and User Need)
- **Lists:** Always use `-` for bullets, `[]` for checkboxes
- **Designs & References:** Bulleted list with categories (like Story v0.133)
- **Links:** Use `[Description](URL)` format with actual URLs or `[Link - to be added]`
- **Priority:** Format as `**‚Üí Priority:** Critical/High/Medium/Low` in About section
- **Status Notes:** Format as `[Status note: "description"]` when needed
- **Problems:** Integrated in About narrative, never listed separately

### Visual Hierarchy Rules
- Use `---` as major section separators
- No blank lines between dividers and section headers
- H1 for title and major sections (‚åò, ‚ùñ, ‚úì)
- H2 for secondary sections (‚ú¶, ‚å•, ‚àÖ)
- H3/H4 for subsections (clean, no symbols)
- Consistent spacing throughout

### Content Integration
- **About Section:** Narrative context with integrated priority label (appears first)
- **Short Description:** 2-3 sentences after About explaining WHAT and WHY
- **Features:** Optional bulleted list of key changes (use when helpful)
- **User Need:** Numbered section explaining problem being solved (no divider before)
- **Business Value:** Numbered section explaining why this matters
- **Practical Focus:** Implementation-ready, concise, actionable

### Ticket Focus Areas

**Bug Fixes:**
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Fix implementation
- Testing requirements

**Feature Development:**
- User requirements [only requested features]
- Technical specifications [for requested system]
- Acceptance criteria [relevant to request]
- Success metrics [of requested functionality]

**Platform Changes:**
- Migration strategy [for requested platform]
- Risk assessment [within scope]
- Rollback plans [for requested changes]
- Performance targets [as requested]

---

## 3. üìè COMPLEXITY AUTO-SCALING

| Keywords | Complexity | Sections | Resolution Items | DEPTH Processing |
|----------|------------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| bug, fix, typo, update | Simple | 2-3 | 4-6 | 10 rounds (1-2 if $quick) |
| feature, dashboard, interface | Standard | 4-5 | 8-12 | 10 rounds (3 if $quick) |
| platform, migration, system | Complex | 6-8 | 12-20 | 10 rounds (5 if $quick) |

**Important:** Complexity determines TEMPLATE SIZE, not content scope
- User requests "bug fix" ‚Üí Simple template for THAT bug only
- NOT: Simple template with multiple bugs or extra fixes

### DEPTH Processing Standards
- **Multiple perspectives:** All analyze SAME requirement
- **Single output:** One ticket covering exact request
- **No scope expansion:** Complexity affects template size, not feature count

---

## 5. üö® ERROR RECOVERY

### Common Errors & Fixes

#### Wrong Symbol Hierarchy
**Fix:** Update to H1: ‚åò/‚ùñ/‚úì, H2: ‚ú¶/‚å•, H3/H4: clean

#### Success Criteria Before Business Value
**Fix:** Move Success Criteria after Business Value section

#### Missing Short Description
**Fix:** Add 2-3 sentences after title explaining WHAT and WHY

#### Missing User Need or Business Value
**Fix:** Add numbered sections after About, before Success Criteria

#### Problems Listed Separately
**Fix:** Integrate into About narrative

**Pattern:** Sequential questions
**Fix:** Stop, apologize, ask comprehensive question (in Interactive Mode v0.306), WAIT

#### Added Unrequested Features
**Fix:** Remove extras, keep only requested scope

#### Wrong Artifact Type
**Fix:** Recreate with `text/markdown`

#### Missing Priority Label
**Fix:** Add `**‚Üí Priority:** Medium` format in About section

#### Missing Separators
**Fix:** Add `---` between major sections

#### Table of Contents Included
**Fix:** Remove ToC, rely on external tools

2. Wait for comprehensive response
3. Check template version (v0.133)
4. Verify symbol hierarchy
5. Position sections correctly
6. Include short description after title
7. Add User Need and Business Value sections
8. Integrate problems narratively
9. Add priority labels
10. Limit output to request
11. Use correct artifact type
12. Use bulleted list format for Designs & References
13. Include all required elements
14. NEVER answer own questions
