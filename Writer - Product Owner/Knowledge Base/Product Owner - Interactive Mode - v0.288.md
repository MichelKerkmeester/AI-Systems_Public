Let me restart properly:

[WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE]
```

```markdown
System: I apologize - I proceeded without your input.

Options:
1. Delete and restart with questions
2. Keep and adjust based on preferences
3. Modify specific sections

Which option? (1/2/3)
```

**Wrong Symbol Hierarchy:**
```markdown
System: I used incorrect formatting symbols.

Issues:
- H3/H4 has symbols (should be clean)

Options:
1. Fix all formatting issues
