## 1. üìñ STORY MODE OVERVIEW

### Command: `$story`

- **Purpose:** Create user stories in narrative format that auto-scale complexity
- **Output:** Always as `text/markdown` artifact
- **Thinking:** 10 rounds automatic (DEPTH methodology), 1-5 auto-scaled for $quick
- **Interactive Mode:** Single comprehensive question gathering ALL requirements
- **Key Difference:** Stories omit Resolution Checklist, focus on user journey and narrative
- **Header Position:** Always at top as first line
- **Output Constraints:** Story contains ONLY the requested feature/capability

### Critical Rules
- **NEVER create artifact until user responds to comprehensive questions**
- **NEVER answer own questions - always wait for user response**
- **NO TABLE OF CONTENTS** - ClickUp/Jira provide native TOC functionality
- **HEADER AT TOP:** System metadata appears as first line of artifact
- **NO RESOLUTION CHECKLIST:** Stories use narrative format with acceptance criteria
- **SHORT DESCRIPTION:** 1-2 concise sentences after title explaining WHAT was built/changed
- **FEATURES SECTION:** Bulleted list of key features immediately after description
- **INTERACTIVE QUESTIONS:** Handled by Interactive Mode v0.305 file, not in template

### Note on Development Tickets
For development tickets with QA checklists and resolution tracking, use `$ticket` command which references **Product Owner - Template - Ticket Mode - v0.133.md**

---

## 2. üì¶ DELIVERY STANDARDS

### Universal Requirements
- **Artifact Type:** Always use `text/markdown` (never `text/plain`)
- **Single Artifact:** All content delivered as one artifact
- **DEPTH Processing:** 
  - Standard modes: 10 rounds automatic (not user choice)
  - Quick mode: 1-5 rounds auto-scaled based on complexity
- **Wait for Input:** NEVER proceed without user response to questions
- **Template Compliance:** Use v0.133 structure exactly

### Story-Specific Standards
- **Scaling:** 
  - Simple: 2-3 sections, focused narrative
  - Standard: 4-5 sections, detailed journey
  - Complex: 6-8 sections, comprehensive scenarios
- **Output Focus:** ONLY deliver what user requested
- **No Scope Expansion:** Template scaling affects structure, not content scope
- **Multiple Perspectives:** All analyze the SAME requirement
- **Convergent Output:** Many approaches considered, ONE delivered
- **User Journey Focus:** Emphasize user perspective and experience
- **No QA Checklist:** Stories end with change summary, not resolution checklists

### Mandatory Structure Elements

#### Symbol Hierarchy
- **H1:** ‚åò (About), ‚ùñ (Requirements), ‚ùñ (Change Summary)
- **H2:** ‚ú¶ (Success), ‚å• (Designs)
- **H3:** Clean headers (no symbols)
- **H4:** #### (Subsections within Requirements and Change Summary)

#### Structure Order
1. About (‚åò) - Context narrative only (no separate User Need/Business Value/Scope)
2. Short description (1-2 sentences) - WHAT was built/changed
3. Features - Bulleted list of key features
4. User Need (numbered) - What problem this solves
5. Business Value (numbered) - Why it matters to business
6. Success Criteria (‚ú¶) - After Business Value
7. Designs & References (‚å•) - Bulleted list with categories
8. Requirements (‚ùñ) - Implementation requirements with H4 subsections
9. Change Summary (‚ùñ) - Section documenting all changes with H4 subsections

#### Formatting Standards
- **Dividers:** Use `---` between all sections (not between description and User Need)
- **Lists:** Always use `-` for bullets, `[]` for checkboxes
- **Designs & References:** Bulleted list organized by categories (Flows, Components, Related Stories)
- **Links:** Use `[Description](URL)` format with actual URLs
- **Requirements:** Use H4 (####) for subsections, not H3
- **Change Summary:** Use H4 (####) for individual change items
- **Priority:** Format as `**‚Üí Priority:** Critical/High/Medium/Low` in About section

### Visual Hierarchy Rules
- Use `---` as section separators
- H1 for title, major sections (‚åò About, ‚ùñ Requirements, ‚ùñ Change Summary)
- H2 for secondary sections (‚ú¶ Success, ‚å• Designs)
- H3 NEVER used in current pattern
- H4 for subsections within Requirements and Change Summary
- No blank lines between dividers and section headers
- Clean headers at H4 level (no symbols)

### Content Integration
- **About Section:** Context narrative only, no bold labels (appears first)
- **Short Description:** 1-2 concise sentences after About explaining WHAT changed
- **Features:** Bulleted list immediately after description
- **User Need:** Numbered section (1.) after Features (no divider before)
- **Business Value:** Numbered section (2.) after User Need
- Clear narrative flow throughout
- Story covers ONLY requested feature
- Emphasis on practical implementation details

### Story Focus Areas

**Implementation:**
- What was built or changed
- Specific component updates
- Technical requirements
- Visual/interaction specifications

**Change Documentation:**
- NEW: Change Summary section at bottom
- Lists all modifications made
- Organized by component or area
- Uses H4 subsections

**Business Value:**
- Why this matters to users
- How it supports business goals
- Impact on user satisfaction
- Measurable outcomes

## 3. üìè COMPLEXITY AUTO-SCALING

| Keywords | Complexity | Sections | Focus | DEPTH Processing |
|----------|------------|----------|-------|------------------|
| simple, basic, quick | Simple | 2-3 | Single component update | 10 rounds (1-2 if $quick) |
| feature, capability, page | Standard | 4-5 | Complete page/feature | 10 rounds (3 if $quick) |
| platform, system, ecosystem | Complex | 6-8 | Multi-component system | 10 rounds (5 if $quick) |

**Important:** Complexity determines TEMPLATE SIZE, not content scope
- User requests "simple button update" ‚Üí Simple template for THAT button only
- NOT: Simple template with multiple button variations or extra features

### DEPTH Processing Standards
- **Multiple perspectives:** All analyze SAME requirement
- **Single output:** One story covering exact request
- **No scope expansion:** Complexity affects template size, not feature count

---

## 4. ÔøΩ COMPLEXITY AUTO-SCALING

- [] DEPTH methodology applied (10 rounds standard, 1-5 quick)?
- [] User responded to comprehensive question?
- [] System waited for response (never answered own questions)?
- [] Complexity determined correctly?
- [] Template version confirmed (v0.133)?
- [] Output scope limited to user request?

### Structure Validation

- [] Requirements section with H4 subsections?
- [] Change Summary section at bottom with H4 subsections?
- [] Correct symbol hierarchy applied (H1: ‚åò/‚ùñ, H2: ‚ú¶/‚å•, H4: ####)?
- [] Using `* * *` dividers between sections?
- [] NO H3 headers used?
- [] NO Resolution Checklist (story-specific)?

### Format Validation
- [] Using `text/markdown` artifact type?
- [] Lists use `*` bullets?
- [] Checkboxes use `[]` format?
- [] Dividers (`* * *`) between all sections?
- [] Clean H4 headers for subsections?
- [] Actual links included (not placeholders)?
- [] No Table of Contents?
- [] No unrequested features?
- [] Content limited to requested feature?

### Story-Specific Validation (v0.133)
- [] Short description explains WHAT was built/changed?
- [] Features section present and concise?
- [] About section is narrative only (no bold labels)?
- [] User Need and Business Value as numbered sections?
- [] Designs organized by category (Flows, Components, etc.)?
- [] Requirements use H4 subsections (not H3)?
- [] Change Summary section present at bottom?
- [] Change Summary organized by component/area?
- [] Implementation focus maintained?
