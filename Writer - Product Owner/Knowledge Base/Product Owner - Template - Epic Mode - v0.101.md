## 1. üöÄ EPIC MODE OVERVIEW

### Command: `$epic`

* **Purpose:** Create detailed feature specifications with implementation details across apps
* **Output:** Always as artifact with hierarchical feature breakdown
* **Thinking Rounds:** 8-10 (detail requires analysis)
* **Feature Depth:** UI/UX specifications, flows, technical requirements
* **Format:** Nested structure with specific implementation details

---

## 2. üìà COMPLEXITY AUTO-SCALING

| Complexity        | Detail Level         | Features       | Documentation | Design Status |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Standard**      | Component-level      | 5-10 features  | 3-5 docs      | Some TBD      |
| **Detailed**      | Implementation-level | 10-20 features | 6-10 docs     | Mixed states  |
| **Comprehensive** | Specification-level  | 20+ features   | 10+ docs      | Full coverage |

---

## 3. üß© DETAILED EPIC TEMPLATE

* **What it is:** A complete cross-app epic blueprint with UI/UX, flows, dependencies, and implementation notes.
* **When to use:** Multi-feature initiatives spanning Creator/Partner apps, or any effort needing end-to-end breakdown.
* **Best practices ‚Äì Do:** Keep scope tight, number features, call out status/dependencies, add success metrics.
* **Best practices ‚Äì Don't:** Mix unrelated initiatives, hide blockers, or omit owner/risks.

## 6. üóÇÔ∏è EPIC FORMATTING RULES

### Hierarchical Detail Structure

```markdown
## ‚óªÔ∏è **App Level**
---
### ‚óä **Feature Area**
---
#### **‚Äî Component or Flow**
---
1. **Specific Element**
    - Implementation detail
    - Technical specification
---
2. **Another Element**: [Variant]
    - Different implementation
    - Additional specification
```

### Feature Status Callouts

```markdown
[Status note: "This has not been designed yet. But will be ready ASAP!"]
[Status note: "This has not been finished yet. But will be ready ASAP!"]
[Technical dependency: "Need details on what's possible before we can design the '[Feature]'."]
```

### Detail Specifications

```markdown
- [Feature with specification (e.g., Aspect ratio: 16:9)]
- [Capability with limit (e.g., up to 12 connected posts)]
- [Field requirement (e.g., Written motivation (Required))]
- [Interaction detail (e.g., Swipe navigation, up or down)]
- [State change (e.g., When they click X, Y opens)]
```

### Complex Nested Lists

```markdown
1. **Category**
    - Main point
    - Sub-detail:
        - Nested item 1
        - Nested item 2
        - Nested item 3
    - Another point
```

### Required Patterns

1. **Dividers:** Always `---` between sections
2. **Bullets:** Always `- ` with 4-space indentation
3. **Status notes:** Italic or bold callouts for design/dev status
4. **Technical notes:** Clear dependencies and requirements
5. **Specifications:** Inline details (e.g., formats, limits, ratios)
6. **Flows:** Step-by-step breakdowns with outcomes
7. **UI Details:** Specific behaviors and interactions

## 7. üó£Ô∏è INTERACTIVE QUESTIONS

### Detail-Focused Epic Flow

```markdown
User: $epic creator platform phase 1

System: Let's create your detailed creator platform epic!

**How many thinking rounds should I use? (8-10)**

Based on "creator platform phase 1", I recommend: 9 rounds
- Complexity: High (multiple features and flows)
- Detail level: Implementation specifications needed
- Apps: Both Creator and Partner sides

Your choice?

[WAIT FOR USER INPUT]

User: 9

System: Let me understand the detail level needed:

1. How many major features to specify? (5-10/10-20/20+)
2. Need technical dependencies noted? (Yes/No)
3. Include "not designed yet" callouts? (Yes/No)

[WAIT FOR ANSWERS]

User: 10-20, Yes, Yes

System: Creating a Detailed Epic with:
- 10-20 features with implementation details
- Technical dependency notes where needed
- Design status callouts for incomplete areas

[CREATES DETAILED EPIC WITH FULL SPECIFICATIONS]
