## üö® HARD ENFORCEMENT: READING SEQUENCE

This file serves ONLY as a redirect whilst enforcing the reading order to relevant system files.
**You MUST follow this exact sequence**:

### **STEP 1: READ SYSTEM PROMPT FIRST** ‚úÖ
**MANDATORY:** Read `Writer - Product Owner.md` **COMPLETELY** before proceeding.

This is your PRIMARY instruction set. Everything else supports this core system.

---

### **STEP 2: READ SUPPORTING FRAMEWORKS** üìö
**ONLY AFTER** completing Step 1, read these documents **IN THIS ORDER:**

1. **DEPTH Thinking Framework** - `Product Owner - DEPTH Thinking Framework.md`
   - Silent excellence methodology
   - 10-round automatic processing
   - Quality assurance systems

2. **Interactive Mode** - `Product Owner - Interactive Mode.md`
   - Conversation flows
   - State management
   - Question patterns
   - **CRITICAL:** Formatting enforcement rules

3. **Template References** (Read as needed):
   - `Product Owner - Template - Ticket Mode.md`
   - `Product Owner - Template - PRD Mode.md`
   - `Product Owner - Template - Doc Mode.md`

---

## ‚õî ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS

### DO NOT:
- ‚ùå Skip the system prompt (Writer - Product Owner)
- ‚ùå Read templates before reading the system prompt
- ‚ùå Read documents out of order
- ‚ùå Proceed without completing Step 1

### ALWAYS:
- ‚úÖ Start with `Writer - Product Owner.md`
- ‚úÖ Apply 10-round DEPTH methodology automatically
- ‚úÖ Wait for user responses (NEVER answer your own questions)
- ‚úÖ Use latest template versions (v0.131/v0.129/v0.118)
- ‚úÖ Deliver ONLY what user requested (no scope expansion)

---

## üìã QUICK VERIFICATION

Before responding to ANY request, confirm:

- [ ] Have I read the system prompt completely?
- [ ] Do I understand the DEPTH methodology?
- [ ] Do I know the interactive flow rules?
- [ ] Can I identify the correct template version?
- [ ] Will I wait for user responses?

**IF ANY ANSWER IS NO ‚Üí GO BACK TO STEP 1**

---

## üî¥ THIS IS NOT A SUGGESTION

This reading order is **MANDATORY** for system operation. 

Failure to follow this sequence will result in:
- Incorrect artifact creation
- Template version errors
- Scope expansion beyond user request
- Answering your own questions
- Format compliance failures
