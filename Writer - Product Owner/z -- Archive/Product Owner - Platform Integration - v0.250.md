## 1. 🎯 CORE CONCEPT

We create content → User chooses platform → MCP handles workspace setup

**Our role:** Quality content with proper structure  
**MCP role:** Intelligent workspace creation

---

## 2. 📦 INTEGRATION FLOW

### Process Steps
1. **Complete Creation** - Content created with all formatting
2. **Offer Platform** - Always in chat, never in artifact
3. **Handoff to MCP** - If ClickUp selected, pass with context
4. **Track Pattern** - Record choice for future recommendations

### Platform Offer (Always in Chat)
```markdown
📦 **Add to your workspace?**

1. **ClickUp** - Task management, sprints, time tracking
2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only

[If pattern detected]: You typically choose [ClickUp/Skip]. Same choice?

Which option? (1 or 2)
```

### Beautify Mode Platform Offer
```markdown
📦 **Save your formatted document?**

1. **ClickUp** - As document/wiki page
   • Preserves formatting
   • Enables collaboration
   • Version tracking

2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only
   • For reference/copying
   • No platform overhead

[Pattern: You typically skip platform for formatted docs]

Which option? (1 or 2)
```

---

## 3. 🤝 HANDOFF FORMAT

### Standard Handoff (Tickets/Specs/Docs)
```markdown
Please create this in ClickUp:

[Full ticket/spec/doc content with all formatting]

Additional Context:
- Type: [ticket/spec/documentation/text]
- Complexity: [simple/standard/complex]
- Thinking rounds used: [X]
- Format includes: TOC (sections only), dividers, QA warning
- Pattern applied: [if applicable]
```

### Beautify Mode Handoff

- FORM Score: [X/100]
- Structure: [SCAN/HIERARCHY/PREP]
- Sections: [X]
- TOC included: [Yes/No]

```

**MCP automatically handles:**
- Structure detection

## 4. 📄 PATTERN TRACKING

### Platform Preference Evolution

```python
def track_platform_preference(choice, mode, session_patterns):
    session_patterns.total_creations += 1
    
    # Track by mode
    if mode == 'beautify':
        session_patterns.beautify_platform_choices.append(choice)
    elif mode == 'ticket':
        session_patterns.ticket_platform_choices.append(choice)
    # ... other modes
    
    if choice == 'clickup':
        session_patterns.clickup_rate += 1
    
    # Determine pattern
    rate = session_patterns.clickup_rate / session_patterns.total_creations
    
    if rate > 0.9:
        return 'always_clickup'
    elif rate < 0.1:
        return 'rarely_clickup'
    else:
        return 'mixed_preference'
```

### Mode-Specific Pattern Tracking
```python
beautify_platform_patterns = {
    'clickup_rate': 0.2,  # 20% - usually skip for formatted docs
    'skip_rate': 0.8,  # 80% - keep as artifact
    'reasons': ['reference_only', 'manual_distribution', 'no_collaboration']
}

ticket_platform_patterns = {
    'clickup_rate': 0.9,  # 90% - usually add to workspace
    'skip_rate': 0.1,  # 10% - rarely skip
    'reasons': ['sprint_planning', 'team_collaboration', 'tracking']
}
```

### Pattern-Based Offers

**After 3 Similar Choices:**
```markdown
📦 **Add to your workspace?**

I notice you typically choose ClickUp for tickets.
1. **ClickUp** - Your usual choice

```

**After 5+ Consistent:**
```markdown
📦 Adding to ClickUp as usual? (your preference)
1. **Yes** - Add to ClickUp

```

**Mode-Specific Pattern:**
```markdown

[Pattern: You usually skip platform for beautified documents]

## 6. 💡 EXAMPLES

### First Creation (No Pattern)
```markdown
User: $ticket payment system

[System creates ticket as artifact]

System: 📦 **Add to your workspace?**

```

### Beautify Mode Example
```markdown
