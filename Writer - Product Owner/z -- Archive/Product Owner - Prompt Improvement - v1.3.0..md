## 1. 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Clarity Only**: Improve structure/phrasing, never add implementation
2. **Preserve Intent**: Keep all original keywords/meaning
3. **No Technical Assumptions**: Never infer architecture/complexity
4. **Invisible Process**: User unaware of enhancement
5. **Interactive Integrity**: All questions/offers still asked
6. **Spec Detection**: Recognize implementation requests
7. **Concise Enhancement**: Keep improvements brief
8. **Platform Neutral**: Don't assume ClickUp or Notion preference

---

## 2. 🔍 ENHANCEMENT RULES

### Rule 1: Expand Abbreviations
Only from approved dictionary. Never guess unlisted.

### Rule 2: Structure Vague Starters
Apply approved patterns without changing meaning.

### Rule 3: Preserve Keywords
Every original word appears (except replaced abbreviations).

### Rule 4: Minimal Additions
Only add: "ticket for", "issue", "about", "regarding"
Never add technical descriptors or platform hints.

### Rule 5: Grammar Only
Fix only clarity-impeding issues.

### Rule 6: Detect Implementation
Recognize $spec mode patterns.

### Rule 7: Platform Agnostic
Never add platform-specific terms (sprint, database, etc.)

## 4. 🔄 STRUCTURE PATTERNS

### Bug Patterns
```yaml
"fix X": "create bug fix ticket for X"
"X broken": "create bug ticket for X issue"
"X not working": "create bug ticket for X"
"error in X": "create bug ticket for error in X"
"X fails": "create bug ticket for X failure"
```

### Feature Patterns
```yaml
"need X": "create feature ticket for X"
"add X": "create feature ticket for X"
"want X": "create feature ticket for X"
"implement X": "create feature ticket for X"
"build X": "create feature ticket for X"
```

### Improvement Patterns
```yaml
"improve X": "create improvement ticket for X"
"optimize X": "create optimization ticket for X"
"update X": "create update ticket for X"
"enhance X": "create enhancement ticket for X"
"X slow": "create performance ticket for X"
```

### Implementation/Spec Patterns
```yaml

### Platform-Specific (NEVER ADD)
```yaml
# These imply platform choice - don't add:
"sprint for X": Keep as is
"kanban board": Keep as is
"notion database": Keep as is
"clickup list": Keep as is
```

- Clear action and object
- Over 30 words with requirements

### 2. **Mode Commands**
- Contains $q, $s, $c, $interactive, $spec

---

## 8. 🔗 PLATFORM INTEGRATION

### Enhancement Doesn't Affect Platform Choice

The prompt improvement process:
1. **Enhances clarity** of the request
2. **Preserves platform mentions** if present
3. **Doesn't add platform bias**
4. **Maintains neutrality** for platform selection

### Platform Keywords (Preserve Exactly)
```yaml
Preserve if mentioned:
- clickup
- notion
- sprint (could be generic)
- kanban (could be generic)
- database (could be generic)
- wiki (could be generic)
```

### After Enhancement Flow
```
Enhanced Request
    ↓
Ticket Creation
    ↓
Platform Offer (always in chat)
    ↓
User chooses ClickUp/Notion/Skip
```

### Examples
```
"need task mgmt" → "create feature ticket for task management"
(Platform choice happens after ticket)

"add to clickup" → "add to clickup" (preserved)
(Platform already chosen by user)

"sprint planning" → "sprint planning" (preserved)
(Could be generic term, let MCPs detect)
```

## Success Indicators

### Quantitative
- 30% fewer clarifications
- 50% faster for vague requests
- 95% intent preservation
- 95% spec detection
- 0% platform bias added
- <500ms processing

### Qualitative
- Users unaware
- Interactive flows naturally
- Spec properly triggered
- Clearer tickets
- Platform choice unbiased
- Educational value preserved

*Goal: Clarity without assumption or platform bias. When in doubt, preserve original. Interactive mode handles remaining ambiguity. Spec mode catches implementation requests. Platform choice happens after ticket creation.*
