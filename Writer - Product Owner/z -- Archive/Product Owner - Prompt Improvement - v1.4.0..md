## 1. 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Clarity Only**: Improve structure/phrasing, never add implementation
2. **Preserve Intent**: Keep all original keywords/meaning
3. **No Assumptions**: Never infer architecture/complexity
4. **Invisible Process**: User unaware of enhancement
5. **Mode Aware**: Detect $ticket, $spec, $doc patterns
6. **Interactive Ready**: All enhancements lead to interactive flow
7. **Concise Enhancement**: Keep improvements brief
8. **Platform Neutral**: Don't assume ClickUp

## 2. 🔍 ENHANCEMENT RULES

### Rule 1: Expand Abbreviations
Only from approved dictionary. Never guess unlisted.

### Rule 2: Structure for Clarity
Apply patterns based on detected intent.

### Rule 3: Preserve Keywords
Every original word appears (except replaced abbreviations).

### Rule 4: Minimal Additions
Only add: "create", "for", "about"
Never add technical descriptors.

### Rule 5: Grammar Only
Fix only clarity-impeding issues.

### Rule 6: Detect Modes
Recognize $ticket, $spec, $doc patterns.

### Rule 7: Platform Agnostic
Never add platform-specific terms.

---

## 3. 🔤 ABBREVIATION DICTIONARY

### Core Technical
```yaml
API: application programming interface
DB: database
UI: user interface
UX: user experience
FE: frontend
BE: backend
FS: full stack
QA: quality assurance

auth: authentication
config: configuration
env: environment
repo: repository
infra: infrastructure

CI/CD: continuous integration/continuous deployment
MVP: minimum viable product
POC: proof of concept

perf: performance
opt: optimization
mem: memory

2FA: two-factor authentication
MFA: multi-factor authentication

JS: JavaScript
TS: TypeScript
```

### Never Add Platform Terms
```yaml
# These suggest specific platforms:
sprint: (keep as is)
kanban: (keep as is)
workspace: (keep as is)
```

---

## 4. 🔄 STRUCTURE PATTERNS

### Ticket Patterns
```yaml
"fix X": "create ticket for X fix"
"X broken": "create ticket for X issue"
"need X": "create ticket for X"
"add X": "create ticket for X feature"
"improve X": "create ticket for X improvement"
```

### Spec Patterns
```yaml
"how to X": "create spec for X"
"CSS for X": "create spec for X styling"
"JS for X": "create spec for X JavaScript"
"build X component": "create spec for X component"
```

### Documentation Patterns
```yaml
"document X": "create documentation for X"
"explain X": "create documentation for X"
"user guide for X": "create documentation for X"
```

### General Patterns
```yaml
"something about X": "need help with X"
"work on X": "create solution for X"
```

---

## 5. ✅ ENHANCEMENT EXAMPLES

### Simple Enhancements
```
"fix auth bug" → "fix authentication bug"
"update API docs" → "update application programming interface documentation"
"need 2FA" → "need two-factor authentication"
```

### Mode Detection
```
"$ticket payment" → (no change - mode detected)
"$spec modal" → (no change - mode detected)
"$doc dashboard" → (no change - mode detected)
```

### Structure Improvements
```
"login broken" → "create ticket for login issue"
"how to center div" → "create spec for centering div"
"document the API" → "create documentation for application programming interface"
```

---

## 6. ❌ WHAT NOT TO DO

### Never Add Implementation
```
❌ "fix login" → "refactor authentication system"
❌ "DB slow" → "add database indexes"
```

### Never Add Complexity
```
❌ "add feature" → "create complex feature ticket"
❌ "fix bug" → "create simple bug ticket"
```

### Never Change Intent
```
❌ "update docs" → "create feature ticket for documentation"
❌ "investigate issue" → "create bug ticket"
```

### Never Add Platform
```
❌ "track tasks" → "create sprint board"
❌ "organize docs" → "create ClickUp list"
```

## 7. 🚦 BYPASS CONDITIONS

Skip enhancement when:

### 1. **Mode Commands**
- Contains $ticket, $spec, $doc
- Already structured

### 2. **Already Clear**
- Proper structure exists
- Over 30 words
- Has requirements

### 3. **Platform Specified**
- "add to clickup"

### 4. **External References**
- Jira tickets (PROJ-123)
- GitHub issues (#123)

### 5. **Detailed Specs**
- Contains acceptance criteria
- Multiple bullet points

## 8. 🔗 MODE DETECTION

### Enhancement Triggers Mode Selection

| Input Pattern | Enhanced To | Mode |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| "fix X" | "create ticket for X fix" | Discovery → Ticket |
| "build X" | "create ticket for X" | Discovery → Ticket |
| "how to X" | "create spec for X" | Discovery → Spec |
| "document X" | "create documentation for X" | Discovery → Doc |
| "$ticket X" | (no change) | Direct Ticket |
| "$spec X" | (no change) | Direct Spec |
| "$doc X" | (no change) | Direct Doc |
