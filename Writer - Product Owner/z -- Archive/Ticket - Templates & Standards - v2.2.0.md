# Ticket - Templates & Standards - v2.2.0

Comprehensive templates, symbols, and formatting standards for all ticket types with developer-first clarity. This is the single source of truth for ticket structure.

## Table of Contents

1. [üìã ARTIFACT STANDARDS](#1--artifact-standards)
2. [üî§ SYMBOL REFERENCE](#2--symbol-reference)
3. [üìê BASE TEMPLATES BY MODE](#3--base-templates-by-mode)
4. [‚ú¶ RESOLUTION CHECKLIST TEMPLATES](#4--resolution-checklist-templates)
5. [üìù FORMATTING STANDARDS](#5--formatting-standards)
6. [üéØ SECTION TEMPLATES](#6--section-templates)

---

## 1. üìã ARTIFACT STANDARDS

### Critical Requirements

**üö® CRITICAL:** Always use `text/markdown` artifact type when delivering structured content!

Never use `text/plain` for content with markdown formatting. This causes raw markdown to display instead of formatted text.

### Mandatory Header

Every ticket artifact MUST start with:

```markdown
MODE: [mode used]
TICKET TYPE: [Feature/Bug/Improvement/Complex/Implementation Brief]
MCP USED: [Sequential Thinking/Cascade Thinking/Figma/Multiple/None Available]
INTERACTIVE OFFERED: [Yes/No/N/A]
```

### Standard Structure

```markdown
MODE: $s
TICKET TYPE: Feature
MCP USED: Sequential Thinking
INTERACTIVE OFFERED: Yes - Declined

---

[Ticket content follows standard template]
```

---

## 2. üî§ SYMBOL REFERENCE

### Primary Section Symbols (Required for Tickets)
- **‚ùñ** - Title and major feature sections
- **‚åò** - About/contextual sections (Complex mode)
- **‚óá** - Process/workflow sections and requirements
- **‚óä** - Sub-headings within sections (for organizing complex requirements)
- **‚Üí** - Designs & References sections
- **‚ú¶** - Success criteria sections (bullets only, no checkboxes)
- **‚úì** - Resolution Checklist sections (checkboxes only, no bullets)
- **‚äó** - Dependencies or out of scope
- **‚ö†** - Risks and important notices
- **‚ö†Ô∏é** - Key problems/changes in descriptions
- **‚Åâ** - Reasons why in descriptions

### Secondary/Organization Symbols
- **‚Äî** - Sub-categories under **‚óä** sub-headings
- **‚óªÔ∏é** - Specific items/components within categories
- **‚óÜ** - Alternative major section marker
- **‚óà** - Document section headers
- **‚ñ∏** - Sub-items or progressive disclosure
- **‚Ä¢** - Bullet points under items

### Symbol Usage Rules
- **‚ú¶** is EXCLUSIVELY for Success Criteria (bullets only, no checkboxes)
- **‚úì** is EXCLUSIVELY for Resolution Checklist sections (checkboxes only, no bullets)
- Never mix these formats - maintain clear distinction

### Spec Mode Approach (Minimal Symbols)
For $spec mode, use conversational format with minimal symbols:
- Standard markdown headers (# ##)
- Code blocks with language specification
- Clean formatting for technical content
- Focus on clarity over decoration

### Symbol Hierarchy Example
```markdown
# ‚ùñ [SCOPE] Main Feature
## ‚óá Requirements
**‚óä** Component Name
‚Äî Category
‚Ä¢ Specific requirement
‚Ä¢ Another requirement
‚Äî Another Category
‚Ä¢ More requirements

## ‚ú¶ Success Criteria
- Success metric 1
- Success metric 2

## ‚úì Resolution Checklist
### Work Stream

## 4. ‚úì RESOLUTION CHECKLIST TEMPLATES

### üö® DISTINCT FORMAT APPROACH

**Core Philosophy:**
- Use **‚úì** symbol for Resolution Checklist sections
- Use **‚ú¶** symbol for Success Criteria
- Resolution Checklist: **Checkboxes only, no bullets**
- Success Criteria: **Bullets only, no checkboxes**
- Think in **work streams**, not tasks
- Each checkbox = **meaningful deliverable**
- Sections = **logical groupings** of related work
- Focus on **WHAT gets delivered**, not HOW
- Maximum **3 items per section**

### Sizing by Mode

| Mode | Total Sections | Items per Section | Total Items |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Quick ($q)** | 2-3 | 2-3 | 4-6 |
| **Standard ($s)** | 4-5 | 2-3 | 8-12 |
| **Complex ($c) - Phased** | 6-8 | 2-3 | 12-20 |
| **Complex ($c) - Child Tickets** | 5-6 | 2-3 | 10-15 |
| **Bug** | 3-4 | 2-3 | 6-10 |
| **Improvement** | 4-5 | 2-3 | 8-12 |
| **Spec ($spec)** | N/A | N/A | Key Points |

---

## 5. üìù FORMATTING STANDARDS

### Titles
- Always use `# ‚ùñ` (h1) for main ticket titles
- Include `[SCOPE]` prefix before feature name (user-specified)
- Keep titles clear and descriptive
- Spec mode: Use `# Frontend Implementation Brief: [Feature]`

### Section Dividers
Always use `---` between ALL major sections

### Text Formatting
- **Bold** for emphasis and key terms (including **‚óä** in sub-headings)
- *Italics* sparingly for subtle emphasis
- `Code` for technical terms
- Em dashes (‚Äî) ONLY for sub-categories under **‚óä** sub-headings

### Code Blocks (Spec Mode)
```markdown
```typescript
// Always specify language for syntax highlighting
const example = "code here";
```
```

### Links
```markdown
[Descriptive Text](url)
[Figma - Component Name](figma-url)
[API Documentation](api-url)
```

### Lists
- Use `-` for unordered lists (Success Criteria)
- Use `1.` for ordered lists
- Use `[ ]` for checkboxes (Resolution Checklist only)
- Indent with 2 spaces for nested items
- Use `‚Ä¢` for bullet points under sub-categories

### Arrows & Flow
- Use `‚Üí` for cause/effect or flow
- Example: `User clicks ‚Üí Modal opens`

### Notices
```markdown
**Notice:** Important information that could be missed
```

## 6. üéØ SECTION TEMPLATES

### Description Template

**Structure:**
1. Brief introduction sentence
2. **‚ö†Ô∏é Key problems/changes:** bulleted list
3. **‚Åâ Reasons why:** impact and outcome statement

**Example:**
```markdown
The current search functionality is failing to meet user needs and causing significant business impact.

‚ö†Ô∏é **Key problems/changes:**
* **Poor relevance** - Results don't match user intent
