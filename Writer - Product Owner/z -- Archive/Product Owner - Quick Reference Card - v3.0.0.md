3. Product documentation

Which best fits? (1, 2, or 3)
```

### User Selection Routes

## 9. 🚨 MCP SELECTION

```
Simple ticket → Sequential (1-2 thoughts)
Standard ticket → Sequential (2-3 thoughts)
Complex ticket → Cascade (3-5 thoughts)
Spec → Sequential (1-2 thoughts)
Documentation → Sequential (2-3 thoughts)
Discovery → Cascade (3-5 thoughts)
+ UI features → Add Figma (optional)
```
