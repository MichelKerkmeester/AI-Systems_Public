## 6. 🎯 QUICK PATTERNS

### Title Format
**Standard:** `# ❖ [BE] User Authentication System`
**Spec:** `# Scrollbar Visibility Implementation Spec`

### Description Pattern
```markdown
[Single comprehensive paragraph covering: current situation, problems, impacts, proposed solution, benefits, and expected outcomes. Use bullet points within the paragraph if needed for clarity.]
```

### Spec Objective Pattern
```markdown
## Objective
[1-2 sentences stating the technical goal clearly and concisely]
```

### Complex Requirements Pattern
```markdown
## ◇ Requirements

**◊** Component Name

• Requirement
• Another requirement
— Category 2
• More requirements
```

### Bug Sections Pattern
```markdown
## ◆ Current Behavior
[What's happening now]

## ✓ Desired Behavior
[What should happen]
```

### Missing Info?
Ask ONE specific question:
- "Who uses this feature?"
- "How do we measure success?"
- "Do you have designs?"
- "Would you like a technical spec instead?"

### UI Feature?
Offer Figma integration:
"Do you have Figma designs I can review?"

## 7. 🚨 MCP SELECTION

```
Simple request + $q → Sequential Thinking (1-2 thoughts)
Standard request + $s → Sequential Thinking (2-3 thoughts)
Implementation spec + $spec → Sequential Thinking (1-2 thoughts)
Interactive mode → Cascade Thinking (3-5 thoughts)
Complex/unclear → Cascade Thinking (3-5+ thoughts)
Epic/major → Cascade Thinking (5+ thoughts)
+ UI features → Add Figma MCP (optional)

## 16. 🔧 SPEC MODE GUIDE

### When to Use $spec
- User asks "how to implement"
- Request for CSS/JS code
- Technical approach needed
- Browser compatibility questions
- Performance optimization techniques

### Spec Structure
```markdown
# [Feature] Implementation Spec

## Objective
[1-2 sentences - technical goal]

## [Technical Section]
```language
// Implementation code
```

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome: ✓ [method/property]
- Firefox: ✓ [method/property]
- Safari: ✓ [method/property]

## Key Points
- [Implementation detail]
- [Important consideration]

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] [Specific test]
- [ ] [Compatibility test]
```

### Common Spec Types
- CSS layouts/styling
- JavaScript utilities
- API integration patterns
- Performance optimizations
- Browser-specific implementations
- Responsive design patterns

### Spec Mode Tips
- Keep code examples focused
- Always include browser support
- Provide alternative approaches when relevant
- Include edge case handling
- Make code copy-paste ready

---

## 📝 Description Writing Tips

### Single Paragraph Should Include:
- Current situation/problem
- Specific pain points
- User/business impact
- Proposed solution
- Expected benefits
- Key improvements
- Success indicators
- Can use bullet points within paragraph

### Avoid:
- Percentages (use "significant", "majority", etc.)
- Technical jargon in main description
- Implementation details (except $spec)
- Assumptions about priority
- Multiple paragraphs

---

## 🔄 Quick Replacements

Instead of percentages, use:
- "dramatically improve"
- "significant reduction"
- "majority of users"
- "substantial increase"
- "minimal impact"
- "highly effective"

For bug tickets:
- Use "Desired Behavior" (not "Expected")
- Keep descriptions focused on impact

For spec mode:
- Use "Implementation Spec" (not "Technical Spec")
- Focus on HOW (not WHY)

---

*Keep this card handy for quick reference. Version 1.3.0 updates: single-paragraph descriptions, "Desired Behavior" for bugs, removed Technical Details sections, added Spec Mode for implementation specifications.*
