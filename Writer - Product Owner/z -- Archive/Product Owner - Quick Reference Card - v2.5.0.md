- Documentation & Training

**Good Items:**
- "[] Build authentication with OAuth"
- "[] Complete cross-browser testing"
- "[] Optimize database queries"

NOT: "[] Write login function", "[] Test in Chrome", "[] Add index"

*Keep this card handy for quick reference. Remember: First heading always has ⌘, be 20% more concise, use `[]` for checkboxes, add dividers between requirement subsections, and always offer platform integration after creation (in chat, not artifact).*
