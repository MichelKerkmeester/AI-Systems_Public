# ‚ùñ [FE] Advanced Search Filters

Our search functionality is failing to meet user needs, resulting in significant business impact and user frustration. Current analytics reveal: **High search abandonment rate** - Majority of users give up before finding what they need; **Multiple search attempts** - Users repeatedly refine queries without success; **Top support complaint** - "Can't find products" represents our most common ticket type; **Lost revenue** - Substantial annual revenue loss from failed product discovery. The root cause is our basic keyword search that returns hundreds of irrelevant results. Users need powerful filtering capabilities to narrow results by category, price, availability, date ranges, and custom attributes. This implementation will provide: **Desktop experience** - Sidebar filter panel with instant results updating; **Mobile experience** - Bottom sheet pattern optimized for touch interaction; **Performance focus** - Fast response times with smart caching; **Accessibility** - Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

**User Value:** Find exactly what you need with powerful filtering options

# ‚ùñ [FS] Multi-user Document Editing

Real-time collaboration has become a critical requirement for our platform as teams increasingly work remotely and asynchronously. Our current file-based sharing system creates significant friction: **Version conflicts** - Majority of shared documents experience merge conflicts requiring manual resolution; **Lost work** - Users report losing significant work time weekly due to overwrites; **Workflow delays** - Teams experience substantial wait times for document handoffs; **Competitive pressure** - We're losing enterprise deals to competitors with real-time features. This comprehensive implementation will transform our document system with Google Docs-level collaboration capabilities while maintaining our enterprise security standards. Technical Approach: **WebSocket infrastructure** for minimal latency updates across all users; **Operational Transformation** algorithms ensuring mathematical convergence of all edits; **Intelligent conflict resolution** that preserves intent from all collaborators; **Offline support** with automatic sync when connection restored. Key Differentiators: **Enterprise security** - All data encrypted in transit and at rest; **Audit trail** - Complete history of who changed what and when; **Performance at scale** - Support 10 concurrent editors without degradation; **No data loss guarantee** - Every keystroke saved and recoverable. The implementation will be delivered in three phases over 6 weeks, starting with basic presence awareness and culminating in full offline support with conflict resolution.

## 5. üêõ BUG TICKET EXAMPLES

### Example: Search Results Reset Bug

```markdown
MODE: $s
TICKET TYPE: Bug
MCP USED: Sequential Thinking

# ‚ùñ [FE] Bug: Search Filters Reset on Back Navigation

A critical user experience bug is severely impacting our search functionality and causing measurable business harm. Impact Assessment: **All users affected** - Every user who applies filters and navigates back loses their selection; **High abandonment rate** - Nearly one in four users leave the site after encountering this bug; **Support volume** - Hundreds of complaints this month about "broken search"; **Revenue loss** - Substantial monthly revenue impact from frustrated users not completing purchases. User Journey Breakdown: 1. User carefully selects multiple filters (category, price range, availability); 2. User clicks on a promising search result to view details; 3. User decides item isn't quite right, clicks browser back button; 4. **FAILURE** - All filters cleared, results reset to default view; 5. User must re-apply all filters from scratch (average 6 clicks); 6. After multiple occurrences, users abandon the site entirely. Technical Investigation: The issue emerged after our v2.3.0 release which updated our routing library. Initial debugging reveals: Filter state stored only in component memory (not preserved across navigation); Browser history API not properly integrated with our state management; URL parameters not syncing with filter selections; Session storage backup mechanism was accidentally removed. This is a P0 issue requiring immediate attention as it directly impacts our core user flow and revenue.

**User Value:** Keep your selected filters when returning to search

# ‚ùñ [FE] Improvement: Dashboard Load Time Optimization

Our analytics dashboard has become a critical pain point that's driving users away from our platform and damaging our reputation. Current Performance Crisis: **Extremely slow initial load** - Users stare at blank screens or spinners for many seconds; **Poor interactivity** - Even after content appears, nothing is clickable for additional seconds; **High bounce rate** - Over one-third of users leave before the page loads; **Mobile performance** - Load times exceed acceptable thresholds on average connections. Business Impact: **User complaints** - "Slow dashboard" is now our second most common support topic; **Churn risk** - Multiple enterprise clients cited performance in non-renewal discussions; **Competitive disadvantage** - Competitors advertise "Lightning fast analytics" against us; **Team productivity** - Our own internal teams waste significant time daily waiting for loads. Root Cause Analysis: Our performance profiling revealed multiple compounding issues: **Bundle size explosion** - JavaScript bundle larger than many mobile apps; **Sequential API calls** - Multiple requests that could be parallelized; **No caching strategy** - Every page load fetches everything fresh; **Render blocking resources** - Large CSS loads before any content appears. Optimization Strategy: We'll implement a comprehensive performance overhaul focusing on: **Code splitting** - Load only what's needed for the current view; **Progressive rendering** - Show content as it becomes available; **Smart caching** - Service worker + HTTP caching for instant subsequent loads; **API optimization** - Parallel requests and GraphQL for precise data fetching. This isn't just a performance improvement‚Äîit's about saving our product's reputation and retaining customers who expect instant access to their data.
