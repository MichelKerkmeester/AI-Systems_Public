## 1. üìã OVERVIEW & PURPOSE

### What is a Resolution Checklist?

A Resolution Checklist is a **mandatory** component of every ticket that provides developers with:
- Clear implementation steps
- Testing requirements
- Quality gates
- Documentation needs
- Deployment tasks

### Sizing Guidelines

| Mode | Items | Structure | Categories | Focus |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Quick ($q)** | 3-5 | Single list | None | Essential tasks |
| **Standard ($s)** | 8-15 | Categorized | 2-3 | Balanced coverage |
| **Complex ($c)** | 15-30 | Phase-based | 3-5 | Progressive work |
| **Epic ($e)** | 10-20 | High-level | 2-4 | Coordination |

### SMART Criteria

Every checklist item should be:
- **S**pecific - Clear what needs to be done
- **M**easurable - Can mark as complete or not
- **A**ctionable - Developer knows how to start
- **R**elevant - Contributes to ticket completion
- **T**ime-bound - Fits within ticket scope

## 5. ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICES

### Writing Effective Checklist Items

**‚úÖ GOOD Examples:**
- "Implement user authentication with JWT tokens"
- "Add email validation to signup form"
- "Write unit tests for cart calculation logic"
- "Update API docs with new endpoint parameters"
- "Test checkout flow on iOS Safari"

**‚ùå POOR Examples:**
- "Make it work" (too vague)
- "Test everything" (not specific)
- "Fix the bug" (no clear action)
- "Use React hooks with Redux" (too prescriptive)
- "Do QA" (not measurable)

### Grouping Guidelines

**Logical Flow:**
1. Implementation tasks first
2. Testing tasks second
3. Documentation/cleanup last
4. Deployment/monitoring final

**Size Limits:**
- No more than 7 items per category
- No more than 30 items total
- Break large items into sub-tasks
- Group related items together

### Adaptation Strategies

**For Simple Features:**
- Keep to essential tasks only
- Combine related items
- Focus on implementation and testing

**For Complex Features:**
- Break into clear phases
- Include checkpoint items
- Add coordination tasks
- Consider rollback steps

**For Team Projects:**
- Add handoff points
- Include review gates
- Specify responsible parties
- Add communication steps

## 6. ‚ùå ANTI-PATTERNS

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Too Vague:**
- ‚ùå "Implement the feature"
- ‚ùå "Make it responsive"
- ‚ùå "Add tests"

**Too Prescriptive:**
- ‚ùå "Use useState hook for form state"
- ‚ùå "Create a PostgreSQL table with 5 columns"
- ‚ùå "Import lodash for array manipulation"

**Not Actionable:**
- ‚ùå "Ensure quality"
- ‚ùå "Follow best practices"
- ‚ùå "Make it fast"

**Out of Scope:**
- ‚ùå "Research new framework" (for a bug fix)
- ‚ùå "Redesign entire system" (for small feature)
- ‚ùå "Write comprehensive documentation" (for quick fix)

### Formatting Mistakes

**Poor Organization:**
- ‚ùå Mixing implementation with testing randomly
- ‚ùå No logical flow between items
- ‚ùå Duplicating items across categories

**Wrong Level of Detail:**
- ‚ùå "Fix line 47 in UserController.js"
- ‚ùå "Change color from #333 to #444"
- ‚ùå "Add semicolon to end of statement"
