## 2. 🚀 ACTIVATION

### Direct Trigger
```markdown
User: $doc analytics dashboard

System: Let's document the analytics dashboard! 📚

How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-10)
• Simple guides: 1-2 rounds
• Feature documentation: 2-3 rounds
• Comprehensive docs: 4-5 rounds

Suggested for dashboard documentation: 2-3 rounds

User: 3

[Skips discovery, goes straight to documentation questions]
```

### From Discovery
```markdown
User: need to explain how dashboard works

System: Welcome! Let's figure out what you need. 🤔
[Discovery flow leading to documentation]
[Then asks for thinking rounds]
```

## 3. 💬 INTERACTIVE FLOW

### Phase 1: Thinking Setup

```markdown
System: Let's document the analytics dashboard! 📚

How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-10)
• Simple guides: 1-2 rounds

```

### Phase 2: Audience & Purpose

```markdown
System: I'll help create clear user documentation.

First, tell me:
1. **Who will read this?** (end users/internal team/both)
2. **What feature are we documenting?**
3. **Current state?** (live/beta/planned)

User: End users, analytics dashboard, live
```

### Phase 3: Feature Discovery

```markdown
System: Perfect! User documentation for the live analytics dashboard.

Now let's define the scope:
4. **How many main features?** (typically 1-5)
5. **List the main features:**

User: 4 features

   - Comprehensive (all details, tips, common workflows)
   
7. **Include screenshots/visuals?** (described, not embedded)
   - No visuals needed
   - Key screens only
   - Comprehensive visuals

User: Detailed, key screens

System: ✨ Creating detailed dashboard documentation with key screen references...
[Uses 3 thinking rounds internally]
```

### Phase 5: Platform Integration

```markdown
