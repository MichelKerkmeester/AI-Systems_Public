# Ticket - Templates & Standards - v1.4.0

Comprehensive templates, symbols, and formatting standards for all ticket types with developer-first clarity. This is the single source of truth for ticket structure.

## Table of Contents

1. [üìã ARTIFACT STANDARDS](#1--artifact-standards)
2. [üî§ SYMBOL REFERENCE](#2--symbol-reference)
3. [üìê BASE TEMPLATES BY MODE](#3--base-templates-by-mode)
4. [‚úÖ RESOLUTION CHECKLIST TEMPLATES](#4--resolution-checklist-templates)
5. [üìù FORMATTING STANDARDS](#5--formatting-standards)
6. [üéØ SECTION TEMPLATES](#6--section-templates)

---

## 1. üìã ARTIFACT STANDARDS

### Critical Requirements

**üö® CRITICAL:** Always use `text/markdown` artifact type when delivering structured content!

Never use `text/plain` for content with markdown formatting. This causes raw markdown to display instead of formatted text.

### Mandatory Header

Every ticket artifact MUST start with:

```markdown
MODE: [mode used]
TICKET TYPE: [Feature/Bug/Improvement/Epic/Implementation Spec]
MCP USED: [Sequential Thinking/Cascade Thinking/Figma/Multiple/None Available]
```

### Standard Structure

```markdown
MODE: $s
TICKET TYPE: Feature
MCP USED: Sequential Thinking

---

[Ticket content follows standard template]
```

---

## 2. üî§ SYMBOL REFERENCE

### Primary Section Symbols (Required)
- **‚ùñ** - Title and major feature sections
- **‚åò** - About/contextual sections
- **‚óá** - Process/workflow sections and requirements
- **‚óä** - Sub-headings within sections (for organizing complex requirements)
- **‚Üí** - Designs & References sections
- **‚úì** - Success criteria sections AND Resolution Checklist
- **‚äó** - Dependencies or out of scope
- **‚ö†** - Risks and important notices
- **‚ö†Ô∏é** - Key problems/changes in descriptions
- **‚Åâ** - Reasons why in descriptions

### Secondary/Organization Symbols
- **‚Äî** - Sub-categories under **‚óä** sub-headings
- **‚óªÔ∏é** - Specific items/components within categories
- **‚óÜ** - Alternative major section marker
- **‚óà** - Document section headers
- **‚ñ∏** - Sub-items or progressive disclosure
- **‚Ä¢** - Bullet points under items

### Spec Mode Symbols (Simplified)
For $spec mode, use minimal symbols for cleaner technical documentation:
- Standard markdown headers (# ##)
- Code blocks with language specification
- Standard bullet points (-)
- Checkboxes for testing (- [ ])

### Symbol Hierarchy Example
```markdown
# ‚ùñ [SCOPE] Main Feature
## ‚óá Requirements
**‚óä** Component Name
‚Äî Category
‚Ä¢ Specific requirement
‚Ä¢ Another requirement
‚Äî Another Category
‚Ä¢ More requirements

**‚óä** Another Component
‚Äî Logic
‚Ä¢ Business logic item
‚Ä¢ Another logic item
```

## 5. üìù FORMATTING STANDARDS

### Titles
- Always use `# ‚ùñ` (h1) for main ticket titles
- Include `[SCOPE]` prefix before feature name
- Keep titles clear and descriptive
- Spec mode: Use plain `#` without symbols

### Section Dividers
Always use `---` between ALL major sections

### Text Formatting
- **Bold** for emphasis and key terms (including **‚óä** in sub-headings)
- *Italics* sparingly for subtle emphasis
- `Code` for technical terms
- Em dashes (‚Äî) ONLY for sub-categories under **‚óä** sub-headings

### Code Blocks (Spec Mode)
```markdown
```language
// Always specify language for syntax highlighting
const example = "code here";
```
```

### Links
```markdown
[Descriptive Text](url)
[Figma - Component Name](figma-url)
[API Documentation](api-url)
```

### Implementation Spec References
When referencing implementation specs within requirements:
```markdown
‚Äî How to implement?
‚Ä¢ Check and follow this implementation spec:
‚Ä¢ {Spec Name}
```

This pattern should be used:
- Under the appropriate requirement sub-heading
- Always as a sub-category with em dash (‚Äî)
- Always with the exact phrasing "How to implement?"
- The spec name in curly braces indicates a linked document

### Lists
- Use `-` for unordered lists
- Use `1.` for ordered lists
- Use `- [ ]` for checkboxes
- Indent with 2 spaces for nested items
- Use `‚Ä¢` for bullet points under sub-categories

### Arrows & Flow
- Use `‚Üí` for cause/effect or flow
- Example: `User clicks ‚Üí Modal opens`

### Notices
```markdown
**Notice:** Important information that could be missed
```

## 6. üéØ SECTION TEMPLATES

### Description Template

**Structure:**
1. Brief introduction sentence
2. **‚ö†Ô∏é Key problems/changes:** bulleted list
3. **‚Åâ Reasons why:** impact and outcome statement

**Example:**
```markdown
The current search functionality is failing to meet user needs and causing significant business impact.

‚ö†Ô∏é **Key problems/changes:**
* **Poor relevance** - Results don't match user intent
* **No filtering** - Users can't narrow down results
* **Slow performance** - Search takes 3-5 seconds
* **Mobile issues** - Interface breaks on small screens

‚Åâ **Reasons why:**
By implementing advanced search with filters, relevance scoring, and performance optimization, we'll dramatically reduce abandonment rates and increase conversion.
```

**Key Icons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏é for problems/changes section
- ‚Åâ for reasons/impact section

### Spec Mode Objective Template

**The objective should be:**
- 1-2 sentences maximum
