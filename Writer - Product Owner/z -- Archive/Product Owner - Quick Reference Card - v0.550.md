- **2+ thinking rounds (beautify mode)**
- 'complete' or 'everything' in request
- 'custom' or 'from scratch'
- Platform or system requests

### Challenge Templates

**Gentle (1-2 rounds):**
"Could this be simpler?"

**Constructive (3-5 rounds):**
"That would work, but a simpler approach would be..."

**Strong (6-10 rounds):**
"Are we solving the right problem?"

**Beautify-Specific (2+ rounds):**
"Would minimal formatting be cleaner?"
"Strict mode preserves your voice better?"

### Response Handling
- **Accepted:** "Excellent! Here's the lean approach..." [Record acceptance]
- **Rejected:** "Understood - [reason] justifies complexity..." [Record justification]

### REPAIR Quick Reference
**R**ecognize → **E**xplain → **P**ropose 3 options → **A**dapt → **I**terate → **R**ecord

### Complexity Auto-Detection

| Keywords | Complexity | Sections | Challenge |
|----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| bug, fix | Simple | 2-3 | "Needed?" |
| feature, dashboard | Standard | 4-5 | "Phase it?" |
| platform, architecture | Complex | 6-8 | "MVP first?" |
| **<500 words** | Minimal | Headers only | "Sufficient?" |
| **500-2000 words** | Standard | Headers + TOC | "Simpler?" |
| **>2000 words** | Deep | Full restructure | "Split?" |

### Platform Integration
```markdown
📦 **Add to your workspace?**
1. **ClickUp** - Task management
2. **Skip** - Keep artifact only

Which option? (1 or 2)
```

**Beautify Platform:**
```markdown
📦 **Save your formatted document?**
1. **ClickUp** - As document/wiki

[Pattern: Usually skip for formatted docs]
```
