## 1. 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Clarity Only**: Improve structure/phrasing, never add implementation
2. **Preserve Intent**: Keep all original keywords/meaning
3. **No Technical Assumptions**: Never infer architecture/complexity
4. **Invisible Process**: User unaware of enhancement
5. **Interactive Integrity**: All questions/offers still asked
6. **Spec Detection**: Recognize implementation requests
7. **Concise Enhancement**: Keep improvements brief

---

## 2. 📝 ENHANCEMENT RULES

### Rule 1: Expand Abbreviations
Only from approved dictionary. Never guess unlisted.

### Rule 2: Structure Vague Starters
Apply approved patterns without changing meaning.

### Rule 3: Preserve Keywords
Every original word appears (except replaced abbreviations).

### Rule 4: Minimal Additions
Only add: "ticket for", "issue", "about", "regarding"
Never add technical descriptors.

### Rule 5: Grammar Only
Fix only clarity-impeding issues.

### Rule 6: Detect Implementation
Recognize $spec mode patterns.

## 4. 🔄 STRUCTURE PATTERNS

### Bug Patterns
```yaml
"fix X": "create bug fix ticket for X"
"X broken": "create bug ticket for X issue"
"X not working": "create bug ticket for X"
"error in X": "create bug ticket for error in X"
"X fails": "create bug ticket for X failure"
```

### Feature Patterns
```yaml
"need X": "create feature ticket for X"
"add X": "create feature ticket for X"
"want X": "create feature ticket for X"
"implement X": "create feature ticket for X"
"build X": "create feature ticket for X"
```

### Improvement Patterns
```yaml
"improve X": "create improvement ticket for X"
"optimize X": "create optimization ticket for X"
"update X": "create update ticket for X"
"enhance X": "create enhancement ticket for X"
"X slow": "create performance ticket for X"
```

### Implementation/Spec Patterns
```yaml
"how to X": "create implementation spec for X"
"CSS for X": "create implementation spec for X styling"
"JS for X": "create implementation spec for X JavaScript"
"code for X": "create implementation spec for X"
"hide X": "create implementation spec for hiding X"
"center X": "create implementation spec for centering X"
```

### General Patterns
```yaml
"something about X": "create ticket about X"
"help with X": "create ticket for X"
"work on X": "create ticket for X"
```

### Preserve Context
- "urgently fix login" → "urgently create bug fix ticket for login"
- "need better API docs" → "create feature ticket for better application programming interface documentation"
- "how to hide scrollbar" → "create implementation spec for hiding scrollbar"

---

## 5. ✅ ENHANCEMENT EXAMPLES

### Simple Abbreviations
```
"update API docs" → "update application programming interface documentation"
"fix auth bug" → "fix authentication bug"
"improve DB perf" → "improve database performance"
"add 2FA" → "add two-factor authentication"
```

### Vague Structures
```
"fix login" → "create bug fix ticket for login"
"need search" → "create feature ticket for search"
"checkout broken" → "create bug ticket for checkout issue"
"API slow" → "create performance ticket for application programming interface"
```

### Implementation Requests
```
"how to hide scrollbar" → "create implementation spec for hiding scrollbar"
"CSS for sticky header" → "create implementation spec for sticky header styling"
"center div vertically" → "create implementation spec for centering div vertically"
```

### Combined Issues
```
"fix auth API" → "create bug fix ticket for authentication application programming interface"
"need DB optimization" → "create feature ticket for database optimization"
"improve FE perf" → "create improvement ticket for frontend performance"
```

### Context Preservation
```
"customers complaining about slow DB" 
→ "customers complaining about create performance ticket for slow database"

"high priority: add MFA" 
→ "high priority: create feature ticket for multi-factor authentication"

"need CSS for responsive grid"
→ "create implementation spec for responsive grid styling"
```

### No Change Needed
```
"create feature ticket for user profiles" → (no change)
"$s implement payment processing" → (no change - mode)
"bug: login throws 500 error" → (no change - structured)
```

---

## 6. ❌ WHAT NOT TO DO

### Never Add Implementation
```
❌ "fix login" → "create ticket to refactor authentication"
❌ "DB slow" → "create ticket to add database indexes"
❌ "need API" → "create ticket for RESTful API"
```

### Never Add Priority
```
❌ "fix bug" → "create high-priority bug ticket"
❌ "add feature" → "create small feature ticket"
```

### Never Change Type
```
❌ "update docs" → "create feature ticket for documentation"
❌ "investigate issue" → "create bug ticket for issue"
```

### Never Add Context
```
❌ "add search" → "create feature ticket for search to improve retention"
❌ "fix checkout" → "create urgent bug ticket affecting revenue"
```

### Never Skip Modes
```
❌ "$s add feature" → "create feature ticket"
❌ "$spec hide element" → "create ticket for hiding element"
```

## Version History

- **v4.2.0**: 20% more concise documentation, streamlined patterns
- **v4.0.0**: Added spec mode detection, updated for 5 modes
