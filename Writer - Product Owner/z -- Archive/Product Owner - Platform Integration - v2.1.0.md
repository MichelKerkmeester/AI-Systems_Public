## 🎯 CORE CONCEPT

We create content → User chooses platform → MCP handles workspace setup

**Our role:** Quality content with proper structure
**MCP role:** Intelligent workspace creation

**Key Updates:**
- All tickets include Table of Contents
- Dividers between all sections
- Key Problems/Reasons with ### → format
- Minimum 2 items for problems/reasons
- Designs & References section always included (◳)
- Dependencies section when needed (⋈)

---

## 📦 INTEGRATION FLOW

### Step 1: Complete Creation
Content created with:
- Thinking rounds applied
- Proper formatting (TOC, dividers)
- Key Problems/Reasons (### → format)
- Designs & References section (◳)
- Dependencies when needed (⋈)
- All required elements

### Step 2: Offer Platform (Always in Chat)
```markdown
📦 **Add to your workspace?**

1. **ClickUp** - Task management, sprints, time tracking
2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only

Which option? (1 or 2)
```

### Step 3: Handoff to MCP
If ClickUp selected, pass content with context

---

## 🤝 HANDOFF FORMAT

```markdown
Please create this in ClickUp:

[Full ticket/spec/doc content with all formatting]

Additional Context:
- Type: [ticket/spec/documentation/text]
- Complexity: [simple/standard/complex]
- Mode: [$ticket/$spec/$doc/$text]
- Thinking rounds used: [X]

```

**MCP will automatically:**

---

## 🎯 WHAT TO RECOMMEND

### Always Suggest ClickUp For:

- Feature requests → Product backlog

### Skip Platform For:
- Single text snippets
- Quick answers
- Temporary content
- Draft iterations

---

## 📋 FORMATTING STANDARDS

### Content Must Include (for tickets):
- **Table of Contents** - All tickets regardless of size
- **Dividers** - Between all sections (---)
- **Key Problems** - ### → Key problems: with 2+ items
- **Reasons Why** - ### → Reasons why: with 2+ items
- **Bullet Format** - Using "- {text}" not bullet symbols
- **Designs & References** - Section with ◳ symbol and placeholders if needed
- **Dependencies** - Section with ⋈ symbol when applicable

## 🚨 ERROR HANDLING

### If MCP Unavailable
```markdown
⚠️ ClickUp MCP not available

Options:
1. Copy formatted text for manual entry
2. Keep as artifact only

Your choice? (1/2)
```

### Manual Instructions Template
```markdown
## For Manual ClickUp Entry:
1. Create new task/list
2. Copy content from artifact (includes TOC and formatting)
3. Set appropriate fields
4. Add to relevant workspace
5. Ensure dividers and formatting are preserved
```

### Format Preservation
```markdown
⚠️ When copying manually, preserve:
- Table of Contents structure
- Dividers between sections
- Key Problems/Reasons formatting (### →)
- Bullet format using "-"
- All section headers
- ◳ for Designs & References
- ⋈ for Dependencies
```
