2. Evaluate scope indicators
3. Check for multiple team involvement
4. Identify compliance/security needs
5. Auto-scale structure accordingly

**Complexity Indicators:**

| Simple | Standard | Complex |
|--------|----------|---------|
| "fix", "bug", "broken" | "feature", "dashboard" | "platform", "architecture" |
| "update", "change" | "workflow", "process" | "migration", "integration" |
| Single component | Multiple components | Multiple systems |
| 1 developer | 1-2 developers | Multiple teams |
| < 1 week | 1-3 weeks | > 1 month |

### Interactive Question Flow

## üö® ERROR HANDLING

### Mode Confusion

```markdown
User: I need something but not sure what

System: No problem! Let me help clarify.

Tell me more about your need:
- Is something broken that needs fixing? ‚Üí Bug ticket
- Building a new feature? ‚Üí Feature ticket
- Need to write code? ‚Üí Implementation spec
- Explaining how something works? ‚Üí Documentation
- Just need some text? ‚Üí Text snippet

What sounds closest to your need?

User: Building a new feature

System: Perfect! Let's create a feature ticket. üéØ

How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-10)
[Continues with ticket flow]
```

### Thinking Uncertainty

```markdown
User: How many rounds should I use? Not sure

System: No worries! Let me help you decide.

For your [feature type]:
- **Quick & simple?** Try 1-2 rounds
  (Bug fix, small update, basic text)
  
- **Standard feature?** Try 3-5 rounds
  (Dashboard, API endpoint, component)
  
- **Complex/Critical?** Try 6-10 rounds
  (Platform, integration, architecture)

Based on what you've described, I'd suggest: [X-Y] rounds

You can always start lower - I'll make the most of whatever you choose!
```

### Complexity Mismatch

```markdown
System: Hmm, you selected 2 thinking rounds but this seems like a complex platform initiative.

Would you like to:
1. **Increase rounds** to 6-8 for better detail
2. **Keep 2 rounds** for a simplified version
3. **Let me suggest** based on complexity

What works best for you?
```

### Missing Information

```markdown
System: I need a bit more information to create the best ticket.

You mentioned "dashboard" but I need to know:
- User-facing or internal admin?
- Analytics, management, or monitoring?
- Real-time or periodic updates?

Quick answers are fine - I'll fill in the structure!
```

### Scope Clarification

```markdown
System: For scope, which teams/areas are involved?

Quick guide:
- [BE] = Backend/server/API
- [FE] = Frontend/UI/client
- [FS] = Full Stack (both)
- [Mobile] = iOS/Android
- [DevOps] = Infrastructure/deployment
- [QA] = Testing/quality

You can select multiple like: [BE][FE]
```

### Platform Integration Error

```markdown
System: ‚ö†Ô∏è ClickUp integration isn't available right now.

Here are your options:
1. **Copy formatted text** - I'll prepare it for manual entry
2. **Download artifact** - Save for later
3. **Try again** - Attempt reconnection

Which would you prefer?

User: 1

System: Here's your ticket formatted for manual ClickUp entry:

## Quick Setup Instructions:
1. Create new task in ClickUp
2. Copy title: "[YOUR TITLE]"
3. Paste description from artifact
4. Add labels: [your labels]
5. Set priority based on complexity
```

### Validation Errors

```markdown
System: ‚ö†Ô∏è I notice a few things to clarify:

1. **No success metrics defined** 
   - How will we measure success?
   
2. **Timeline not specified**
   - Any deadline or estimate?
   
3. **Dependencies unclear**
   - Any blockers or requirements?

Would you like to:
- Add these details now
- Proceed without them
- Let me suggest defaults
```

### Recovery Patterns

**From Confusion:**
```markdown
System: Let's restart with a clearer approach.

Instead of trying to figure out the format, just tell me:
- What problem are you solving?
- Who needs this?
- What's the desired outcome?

I'll determine the best format for you!
```

**From Errors:**
```markdown
System: Something went wrong, but I can recover!

I have your information saved:
- Feature: [what you described]
- Complexity: [detected level]
- Thinking: [rounds selected]

Ready to continue? (yes/no)
```

**From Interruption:**
```markdown
System: Looks like we got interrupted! 

Where we left off:
- Creating: [ticket/spec/doc]
- Completed: [sections done]
- Remaining: [what's left]

Continue where we left off? (yes/start over)
```
