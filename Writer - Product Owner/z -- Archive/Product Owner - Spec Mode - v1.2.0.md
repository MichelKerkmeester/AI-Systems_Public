## 1. üìã OVERVIEW

Spec mode creates **concise frontend implementation specs** through interactive guidance, skipping the discovery phase since it knows you want implementation code.

### Core Principles
- **Interactive always** - Guides through technical choices
- **Skips discovery** - Knows it's implementation
- **20-60 lines typical** - Concise, working code
- **Copy-paste ready** - Real solutions
- **Smart questions** - Framework, features, performance

### When to Use
- CSS/styling solutions
- Component implementations
- Performance optimizations
- Browser compatibility fixes
- State management patterns
- Accessibility implementations

## 2. üöÄ ACTIVATION

### Direct Trigger
```markdown
User: $spec modal component

System: Let's build your modal component! üîß

Quick setup:
1. **Framework?** (React/Vue/Vanilla)
2. **Features needed?** (close button, overlay, animation)
3. **Accessibility requirements?**

[Skips discovery, goes straight to implementation questions]
```

### From Discovery
```markdown
User: how to build a sticky header

System: Welcome! Let's figure out what you need. ü§î

[Discovery flow leading to spec mode]
```

### MCP Selection
- **Primary**: Sequential Thinking (1-2 thoughts)
- **Complex specs**: Sequential (2-3 thoughts)
- **Never**: Cascade (too heavy for specs)

---

## 3. üí¨ INTERACTIVE FLOW

### Phase 1: Core Requirements

```markdown
System: Let's build your [feature] implementation! üîß

Quick setup:
1. **What exactly are you building?**
2. **Framework?** (React/Vue/Vanilla)
3. **Any specific requirements?**

User: Data table, React, needs sorting and pagination
```

### Phase 2: Feature Details

```markdown
System: React data table with sorting and pagination. Got it!

Additional details:
4. **Approximate data size?** (helps optimize)
5. **Virtual scrolling needed?**
6. **Any styling framework?** (Tailwind, Material-UI, custom)

User: 1000 rows max, no virtual scrolling, Tailwind

System: ‚ú® Creating optimized React data table...
```

### Phase 3: Implementation Generation

```markdown
[Generates complete implementation with:]
- Working code
- Performance notes
- Browser compatibility
- Usage examples
```

### Phase 4: Platform Integration

```markdown
System: üì¶ **Add to your workspace?**

1. **ClickUp** - Task management, code snippets
2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only

Which option? (1 or 2)
```

## 4. üéØ PATTERN DETECTION

### Quick Patterns (1-2 questions)

| Pattern | Detection | Questions |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **CSS Utility** | "hide", "center", "style" | Browser support? |
| **Simple Component** | "button", "input", "card" | Framework? |
| **Animation** | "animate", "transition" | Duration? Easing? |
| **Layout** | "grid", "flex", "responsive" | Breakpoints? |

### Standard Patterns (2-3 questions)

| Pattern | Detection | Questions |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Data Display** | "table", "list", "grid" | Framework? Size? Features? |
| **Form** | "validation", "form", "input" | Fields? Validation type? |
| **State** | "context", "store", "state" | Local/global? Framework? |

### Complex Patterns (3-4 questions)

| Pattern | Detection | Questions |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Performance** | "optimize", "virtual", "lazy" | Current metrics? Target? |
| **Integration** | "api", "websocket", "real-time" | Protocol? Auth? Rate limits? |
| **Accessibility** | "a11y", "aria", "screen reader" | WCAG level? Features? |

## 6. üí° EXAMPLES

### Example: Simple CSS

```markdown
User: $spec hide scrollbar

System: Let's build your scrollbar hiding solution! üîß

Quick question:
1. **Need scroll functionality preserved?**
2. **Browser support requirements?**

User: Yes preserve scroll, all browsers

System: ‚ú® Creating cross-browser solution...

# Hidden Scrollbar

## Objective
Hide scrollbar while maintaining scroll functionality.

## Implementation
```css
.hide-scrollbar {
  overflow-y: auto;
  scrollbar-width: none; /* Firefox */
  -ms-overflow-style: none; /* IE/Edge */
}

.hide-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar {
  display: none; /* Chrome/Safari/Opera */
}
```

## Key Points
- Pure CSS solution
- Scroll functionality preserved
- Works across all major browsers
```

### Example: React Component

```markdown
User: $spec autocomplete component

System: Let's build your autocomplete component! üîß

Quick setup:
1. **Framework?** (React/Vue/Vanilla)
2. **Data source?** (local/API)
3. **Features?** (debounce, highlight, keyboard nav)

User: React, local data, all features

System: ‚ú® Creating feature-rich React autocomplete...

[Generates complete React component with debouncing, highlighting, and keyboard navigation]
```

## 7. üîß PLATFORM INTEGRATION

### After Spec Creation

```markdown
üì¶ **Add to your workspace?**

1. **ClickUp** - Add as code snippet to tasks
2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only

Which option? (1 or 2)
```

### Platform Recommendations
- **Component library** ‚Üí ClickUp (code snippets)
- **Bug fix code** ‚Üí ClickUp (attach to ticket)
- **Reference implementation** ‚Üí ClickUp

## 8. ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICES

### For System
1. **Skip discovery** - $spec knows its purpose
2. **Interactive always** - Guide technical choices
3. **Concise questions** - 1-4 maximum
4. **Working code** - No placeholders
5. **Smart defaults** - Modern browsers, common patterns
6. **Platform aware** - Offer integration

### For Users
1. **Use $spec** - Skip discovery phase
2. **Be specific** - "modal with animations" vs "modal"
3. **Answer quickly** - Short responses work
4. **Trust defaults** - System suggests good options
5. **Copy-paste ready** - Code works immediately

### Quality Indicators
- **Interactive flow** - Questions asked
- **Complete code** - No placeholders
- **Optimized** - For stated requirements
- **Compatible** - Browser notes included
- **Documented** - Key points explained

### Output Sizing

| Complexity | Lines | Questions | Time |
|------------|-------|-----------|------|
| **Simple** | 10-20 | 1-2 | Instant |
| **Standard** | 20-40 | 2-3 | 1 minute |
| **Complex** | 40-60 | 3-4 | 2 minutes |
