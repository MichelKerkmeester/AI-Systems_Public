## 1. 📋 ARTIFACT STANDARDS

### Critical Requirements

**🚨 CRITICAL:** Always use `text/markdown` artifact type when delivering structured content!

Never use `text/plain` for content with markdown formatting. This causes raw markdown to display instead of formatted text.

### Mandatory Header

Every ticket artifact MUST start with:

```markdown
MODE: [mode used]
TICKET TYPE: [Feature/Bug/Improvement/Epic]
MCP USED: [Sequential Thinking/Cascade Thinking/Figma/Multiple/None Available]
```

### Standard Structure

```markdown
MODE: $s
TICKET TYPE: Feature
MCP USED: Sequential Thinking

---

[Ticket content follows standard template]
```

---

## 2. 🔤 SYMBOL REFERENCE

- **❖** - Title and major feature sections
- **⌘** - About/contextual sections
- **◇** - Process/workflow sections and requirements
- **→** - Designs & References sections

```

### Lists
- Use `-` for unordered lists
- Use `1.` for ordered lists
- Use `- [ ]` for checkboxes
- Indent with 2 spaces for nested items

- [ ] 90% of users complete task successfully
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in production
- [ ] Analytics tracking implemented
```

### Designs & References Section

```markdown
## → Designs & References

### ◻︎ Design Files
- [Figma - Desktop Flow](link)
- [Figma - Mobile Flow](link)

### ◻︎ Technical Documentation
