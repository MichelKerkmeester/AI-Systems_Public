- Error states for failed payment method updates  
- Loading states for data-heavy sections
- Offline message when connection lost
- Permission-based UI variations

**Complexity Assessment:**
- 12 main screens + numerous substates = high complexity
- Mobile required significant layout adaptations
- Accessibility considerations throughout
- Multiple integration points visible in designs

## 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### ‚ùå In Figma Usage
- ‚äó Don't extract technical specifications unless user requests
- ‚äó Don't include CSS values or measurements unless asked
- ‚äó Don't turn tickets into design documentation automatically
- ‚äó Don't skip user value for design details
- ‚äó Don't force complexity where none exists

### ‚ùå In Requirements Writing
- ‚äó Don't describe HOW to implement (unless user asks)
- ‚äó Don't copy design specs without user request
- ‚äó Don't focus on visual details over function
- ‚äó Don't assume designs are final
