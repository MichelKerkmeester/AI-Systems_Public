## 5. üí° BUSINESS LOGIC DESCRIPTIONS

### Business Rule Template
```markdown
# Rule: [RuleName]

## Brief Description
"[Enforces/Calculates/Validates] [business concept] based on [conditions]."

## Logic
"When [trigger], evaluate [criteria] to determine [outcome]. If [condition A], then [action A]. Else if [condition B], then [action B]. Default: [fallback]."

## Formula
```
IF (condition1 AND condition2) THEN
  result = calculation
ELSE IF (condition3) THEN  
  result = alternative
ELSE
  result = default
```

## Dependencies
"Requires [data] from [sources]. Must execute [before/after] [other rule]."

## Edge Cases
"Handles [null values] by [approach]. When [race condition], [resolution]."
```

### Workflow Template
```markdown
# Workflow: [WorkflowName]

## Brief Description
"Orchestrates [process] through [number] stages with [decision points]."

## Stages
1. **Initiation**: [Trigger] creates [entity] with [initial state]
2. **Processing**: [Actor] performs [action] resulting in [state change]
3. **Validation**: System checks [criteria] before [progression]
4. **Completion**: [Final action] marks [end state]

## Transitions
"Move from [Stage A] to [Stage B] when [condition]. Revert to [Stage C] if [error]."

## 7. üìö DOCUMENTATION SNIPPETS

### How It Works Template
```markdown
# How [Feature] Works

## Overview
"[Feature] operates by [high-level process] to achieve [goal]."

## Process
"When you [initiate action], the system [step 1]. This triggers [step 2] which [transformation]. The result is [step 3] before [outcome]. Throughout, [monitoring] ensures [quality]."

## Technical Details
"[Component A] handles [responsibility], while [Component B] manages [other responsibility]. Data flows from [source] through [pipeline] to [destination]."

"User wants to [use case]: They [action] with [data]. System [processes] in [time]. Result shows [output]."
```

### Configuration Template
```markdown
# Configuration: [Setting Name]

## Brief Description
"Controls [behavior/feature] affecting [system aspect]."

## Details
"Determines [detailed behavior] of [system/feature]. When set to [value A], system [behavior A]. When [value B], it [behavior B]. Default [value] recommended for [use case]."

## Valid Values
