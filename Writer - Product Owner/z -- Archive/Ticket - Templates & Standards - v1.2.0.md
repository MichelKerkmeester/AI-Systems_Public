2. [🔤 SYMBOL REFERENCE](#2--symbol-reference)
3. [📐 BASE TEMPLATES BY MODE](#3--base-templates-by-mode)

## 1. 📋 ARTIFACT STANDARDS

### Critical Requirements

**🚨 CRITICAL:** Always use `text/markdown` artifact type when delivering structured content!

Never use `text/plain` for content with markdown formatting. This causes raw markdown to display instead of formatted text.

### Mandatory Header

Every ticket artifact MUST start with:

```markdown
MODE: [mode used]
TICKET TYPE: [Feature/Bug/Improvement/Epic]
MCP USED: [Sequential Thinking/Cascade Thinking/Figma/Multiple/None Available]
```

### Standard Structure

```markdown
MODE: $s
TICKET TYPE: Feature
MCP USED: Sequential Thinking

---

[Ticket content follows standard template]
```

---

## 2. 🔤 SYMBOL REFERENCE

### Primary Section Symbols (Required)
- **❖** - Title and major feature sections
- **⌘** - About/contextual sections
- **◇** - Process/workflow sections and requirements
- **◊** - Sub-headings within sections (for organizing complex requirements)
- **→** - Designs & References sections
- **✓** - Success criteria sections AND Resolution Checklist
- **⊗** - Dependencies or out of scope
- **⚠** - Risks and important notices

### Secondary/Organization Symbols
- **—** - Sub-categories under **◊** sub-headings
- **◻︎** - Specific items/components within categories
- **◆** - Alternative major section marker
- **◈** - Document section headers
- **▸** - Sub-items or progressive disclosure
