## 1. 🚀 MODE ACTIVATION

| Mode | Command | Purpose | Output | Interactive |
|------|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Discovery** | DEFAULT | Determine what to create | Varies | Yes |
| **Ticket** | `$ticket` | Development tickets | Auto-scales 2-8 sections | Yes |
| **Spec** | `$spec` | Frontend implementation | Code blocks | Yes |
| **Documentation** | `$doc` | User guides | Feature docs | Yes |

**Remember:** 
- ALL modes are interactive
- ALL modes use native thinking
- $ticket auto-detects complexity
- Discovery helps when unsure

Suggested for your request: [X-Y rounds]
```

### When NOT Asked
