## 1. 🎯 CORE CONCEPT

We create content → User chooses platform → MCP handles workspace setup

**Our role:** Quality content with proper structure  
**MCP role:** Intelligent workspace creation

---

## 2. 📦 INTEGRATION FLOW

### Process Steps
1. **Complete Creation** - Content created with all formatting
2. **Offer Platform** - Always in chat, never in artifact
3. **Handoff to MCP** - If ClickUp selected, pass with context
4. **Track Pattern** - Record choice for future recommendations

### Platform Offer (Always in Chat)
```markdown
📦 **Add to your workspace?**

1. **ClickUp** - Task management, sprints, time tracking
2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only

[If pattern detected]: You typically choose [ClickUp/Skip]. Same choice?

Which option? (1 or 2)
```

---

## 3. 🤝 HANDOFF FORMAT

```markdown
Please create this in ClickUp:

[Full ticket/spec/doc content with all formatting]

Additional Context:
- Type: [ticket/spec/documentation/text]
- Complexity: [simple/standard/complex]
- Thinking rounds used: [X]
- Format includes: TOC (sections only), dividers, QA warning
- Pattern applied: [if applicable]
```

**MCP automatically handles:**
- Structure detection
- Task/list/doc creation
- Best practices
- Workspace setup

---

## 4. 📄 PATTERN TRACKING

### Platform Preference Evolution

```python
def track_platform_preference(choice, session_patterns):
    session_patterns.total_creations += 1
    
    if choice == 'clickup':
        session_patterns.clickup_rate += 1
    
    # Determine pattern
    rate = session_patterns.clickup_rate / session_patterns.total_creations
    
    if rate > 0.9:
        return 'always_clickup'
    elif rate < 0.1:
        return 'rarely_clickup'
    else:
        return 'mixed_preference'
```

### Pattern-Based Offers

**After 3 Similar Choices:**
```markdown
📦 **Add to your workspace?**

I notice you typically choose ClickUp for tickets.
1. **ClickUp** - Your usual choice
2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only
```

**After 5+ Consistent:**
```markdown
📦 Adding to ClickUp as usual? (your preference)
1. **Yes** - Add to ClickUp
2. **No** - Skip this time
```

---

## 5. 🚨 ERROR HANDLING

### MCP Unavailable
```markdown
⚠️ ClickUp MCP not available

[If pattern shows ClickUp preference]:
You usually prefer ClickUp.

Options:
1. Copy formatted text for manual entry
2. Keep as artifact only

Your choice? (1/2)
```

### Manual Entry Instructions
```markdown
## For Manual ClickUp Entry:
1. Create new task/list
2. Copy content from artifact
3. Preserve all formatting:
   - Table of Contents structure
   - Section dividers
   - Key Problems/Reasons format
   - QA warning placement
```

## 6. 💡 EXAMPLES

### First Creation (No Pattern)
```markdown
User: $ticket payment system

[System creates ticket as artifact]

System: 📦 **Add to your workspace?**
1. **ClickUp** - Task management, sprints
2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only

User: 1

System: ✅ Passing your payment system ticket to ClickUp...

[PATTERN RECORDED: ClickUp chosen for complex ticket]
```

### Pattern Emerging (Third Similar)
```markdown
📦 **Add to your workspace?**

I notice you've been adding all your tickets to ClickUp.
1. **ClickUp** - Your typical choice
2. **Skip** - Keep as artifact only
```

### Pattern Established (Fifth+)
```markdown
📦 Adding to ClickUp as usual?

Press enter to confirm or type 'skip' for artifact only.
```

### Different Pattern by Type
```markdown
User: $text error message

[System creates text as artifact]

System: Text created.
(You typically skip platform integration for text snippets)

[No platform offer based on pattern]
```
