# Ticket - Templates & Standards - v2.0.0

Comprehensive templates, symbols, and formatting standards for all ticket types with developer-first clarity. This is the single source of truth for ticket structure.

## Table of Contents

1. [üìã ARTIFACT STANDARDS](#1--artifact-standards)
2. [üî§ SYMBOL REFERENCE](#2--symbol-reference)
3. [üìê BASE TEMPLATES BY MODE](#3--base-templates-by-mode)
4. [‚úÖ RESOLUTION CHECKLIST TEMPLATES](#4--resolution-checklist-templates)
5. [üìù FORMATTING STANDARDS](#5--formatting-standards)
6. [üéØ SECTION TEMPLATES](#6--section-templates)

---

## 1. üìã ARTIFACT STANDARDS

### Critical Requirements

**üö® CRITICAL:** Always use `text/markdown` artifact type when delivering structured content!

Never use `text/plain` for content with markdown formatting. This causes raw markdown to display instead of formatted text.

### Mandatory Header

Every ticket artifact MUST start with:

```markdown
MODE: [mode used]
TICKET TYPE: [Feature/Bug/Improvement/Complex/Implementation Brief]
MCP USED: [Sequential Thinking/Cascade Thinking/Figma/Multiple/None Available]
INTERACTIVE OFFERED: [Yes/No/N/A]
```

### Standard Structure

```markdown
MODE: $s
TICKET TYPE: Feature
MCP USED: Sequential Thinking
INTERACTIVE OFFERED: Yes - Declined

---

[Ticket content follows standard template]
```

---

## 2. üî§ SYMBOL REFERENCE

### Primary Section Symbols (Required for Tickets)
- **‚ùñ** - Title and major feature sections
- **‚åò** - About/contextual sections (Complex mode)
- **‚óá** - Process/workflow sections and requirements
- **‚óä** - Sub-headings within sections (for organizing complex requirements)
- **‚Üí** - Designs & References sections
- **‚úì** - Success criteria sections AND Resolution Checklist
- **‚äó** - Dependencies or out of scope
- **‚ö†** - Risks and important notices
- **‚ö†Ô∏é** - Key problems/changes in descriptions
- **‚Åâ** - Reasons why in descriptions

### Secondary/Organization Symbols
- **‚Äî** - Sub-categories under **‚óä** sub-headings
- **‚óªÔ∏é** - Specific items/components within categories
- **‚óÜ** - Alternative major section marker
- **‚óà** - Document section headers
- **‚ñ∏** - Sub-items or progressive disclosure
- **‚Ä¢** - Bullet points under items

### Spec Mode Approach (Minimal Symbols)
For $spec mode, use conversational format with minimal symbols:
- Standard markdown headers (# ##)
- Code blocks with language specification
- Clean formatting for technical content
- Focus on clarity over decoration

### Symbol Hierarchy Example
```markdown
# ‚ùñ [SCOPE] Main Feature
## ‚óá Requirements
**‚óä** Component Name
‚Äî Category
‚Ä¢ Specific requirement
‚Ä¢ Another requirement
‚Äî Another Category
‚Ä¢ More requirements

**‚óä** Another Component
‚Äî Logic
‚Ä¢ Business logic item
‚Ä¢ Another logic item
```

## 6. üéØ SECTION TEMPLATES

### Description Template

**Structure:**
1. Brief introduction sentence
2. **‚ö†Ô∏é Key problems/changes:** bulleted list
3. **‚Åâ Reasons why:** impact and outcome statement

**Example:**
```markdown
The current search functionality is failing to meet user needs and causing significant business impact.

‚ö†Ô∏é **Key problems/changes:**
* **Poor relevance** - Results don't match user intent
