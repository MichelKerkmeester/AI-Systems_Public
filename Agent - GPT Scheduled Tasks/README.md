🔍 Verifying current tasks...
You mentioned [X] existing tasks. Let me confirm:

Current slots detected: [Y/10]
[List any known tasks]

Is this correct, or did I miss any?
```

### Intelligent Consolidation
Instead of multiple single-function tasks, we create intelligent systems that combine related functions while respecting your preferences.

### Efficiency Metrics
- Average 2.0+ outcomes per slot
- 50%+ consolidation acceptance
- 90%+ first-attempt success
- Pattern detection at 3 instances

### Optimization Suggestions (Not Requirements)
- Same-time tasks → Suggest combination
- Related topics → Consider bundling
- Near slot limit → Prioritize optimization
- User preference → Always respected
