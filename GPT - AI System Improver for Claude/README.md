.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create Custom GPT in ChatGPT
1. Open ChatGPT ‚Üí Create new GPT
2. Name it: **GPT - AI System Improver**

### Step 2: Add System Instructions
1. Copy the system prompt
2. Paste into Instructions field
3. Save configuration

### Step 3: Upload Reference Documents
Add these core files:
- **GPT - AI System Improver - ATLAS Thinking Framework.md** - Thinking methodology
- **GPT - AI System Improver - Interactive Intelligence.md** - Conversation patterns

### Step 4: Start Using
```
# System automatically applies deep reasoning

"Help with my prompt"            # Interactive Discovery
"Fix typos in [content]"         # Direct mode
$quick                           # Minimal scope with deep analysis
$status                         # Show current state
```

.

## üìÑ Interactive Discovery

### Auto-Activation
Deep reasoning identifies gaps, then asks only critical questions:
- Request unclear after analysis
- Critical information missing
- Multiple valid interpretations
- First interaction
- High complexity needs clarity

### Discovery Questions (2-4 max)
```
**Deep analysis identified gaps:**

1. **What are we working with?**
   [My analysis suggests X, please confirm]

2. **Main goal?**
   [Based on analysis, seems like Y]

3. **Must preserve?**
   [Analysis indicates these are critical]

4. **Who uses this?**
   [This impacts approach significantly]
```

.

## üß† Deep Reasoning Mode

### Always Maximum Depth
The system **always** uses GPT-5 High Deep Reasoning mode. No user input needed - every request gets maximum thinking depth automatically.

### How It Works
1. Request received
2. Deep reasoning applied (GPT-5 High)
3. Complexity assessed automatically
4. ATLAS phases selected based on analysis
5. Challenge presented if beneficial
6. Artifact created with deep thinking
7. Complete delivery

### Complexity-Based Phase Selection
| Complexity | Auto-Selected Phases | Deep Reasoning Focus |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Low (1-3)** | A‚ÜíS | Deep analysis of minimal changes |
| **Medium (4-5)** | A‚ÜíT‚ÜíS | Deep option evaluation |
| **High (6-7)** | A‚ÜíT‚ÜíL‚ÜíS | Deep decision analysis |
| **Very High (8+)** | Full ATLAS | Complete systematic analysis |

.

## üìä ATLAS Framework

### Automatic Phase Selection
System automatically determines which ATLAS phases to apply based on deep complexity analysis:

**A - Aim** (Always Active)
- Deep problem analysis
- Comprehensive scope definition
- Complete risk assessment

**T - Think** (Medium+ Complexity)
- Generate all viable options
- Deep trade-off analysis
- Score Impact/Effort/Risk

**L - Lock** (High+ Complexity)
- Comprehensive decision rationale
- Complete test coverage
- Rollback planning

**A - Act** (Very High Complexity)
- Meticulous implementation
- Comprehensive testing
- Thorough documentation

**S - Ship** (Always Active)
- Quality gates check
- Create Delta Log
- Deliver complete artifact

### Structural Change Protocol
```
PROPOSAL (After Deep Analysis):
Title: [change description]
Impact: [thorough assessment]
Risk: [comprehensive analysis]
Benefits: [complete evaluation]

Proceed? (yes/no required)
```

.

## üöÄ Challenge Mode

### Automatic Based on Complexity
```
**Deep analysis reveals alternatives:**

**A: Minimal**
‚Ä¢ What: [specific changes from analysis]
‚Ä¢ Impact: 2/5 | Effort: 1/5 | Risk: 1/5
‚Ä¢ Deep insight: [why sufficient]

**B: Standard**
‚Ä¢ What: [balanced improvements]
‚Ä¢ Impact: 3/5 | Effort: 3/5 | Risk: 2/5
‚Ä¢ Deep insight: [why balanced]

**C: Comprehensive**
‚Ä¢ What: [full enhancement]
‚Ä¢ Impact: 5/5 | Effort: 5/5 | Risk: 3/5
‚Ä¢ Deep insight: [when worth it]

[Deep analysis recommends: X]
Which approach?
```

### Challenge Triggers
- Complexity score > 5
- Multiple valid approaches found
- Simpler alternative identified
- Over-engineering detected

.

## üìù Session Tracking

### ChatGPT-Compatible Tracking
- **Within conversation only** - No cross-session memory
- **Resets on new chat** - Each conversation starts fresh
- **Informative notes** - Shows as "[This session: ...]"
- **Never restricts** - All options always available

### What Gets Tracked
```python
session_data = {
    'deep_analyses': [],        # Analysis results
    'complexity_scores': [],    # Detected complexity
    'challenge_accepted': [],   # User choices
    'atlas_phases_used': [],    # Selected phases
    'interactions': 0           # Total in session
}
```
