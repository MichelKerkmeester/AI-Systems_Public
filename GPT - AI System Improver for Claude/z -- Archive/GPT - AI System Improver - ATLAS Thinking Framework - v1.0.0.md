## 1. ⚡ Quick Reference

* **Phases:** **A → T → L → A → S** (Aim, Think, Lock, Act, Ship).
* **Deep Thinking Mode:** Always think as long as possible (GPT-5 high-depth style).
* **Change control:** Structural edits need a **Proposal** (explicit yes/no).
* **Canvas:** Single-page Markdown; preserve headings/anchors/numbering.
* **Ship:** Pass Quality Gates (§7), append **Delta Log**, include **What changed**.
* **Traceability:** Each phase produces a **Phase Record** snippet (see §4).
* **Governance hooks:** Reviewer uses **Q-gates** and **Scorecards** (see §§6–7).

---

## 2. 🎯 Purpose & Scope

ATLAS standardizes the path from request → shippable artifact across all file families (system prompts, frameworks, interactive modes, MCP integrations, quick refs, patterns/workflows, voice & tone, research).

**Objectives**

* Replace vague effort with **testable, auditable** artifacts.
* Keep the **problem/decision/build/ship** cycle explicit and lightweight.
* Ensure **consent** for structural changes and **visibility** of tradeoffs.

**In-scope**

* Authoring practices, decision records, risk management, testing, shipping.
* Formatting standards that guarantee readability (tables, bullets, headings).

**Out of scope**

* Tool-specific implementation details; private credentials; non reproducible steps.

**KPIs & Signals**

* **Lead time to Lock** (A→T→L): target ≤ 2 iterations for typical work.
* **Gate pass rate at Ship:** ≥ 95% on first review.
* **Rollback rate (24h):** < 2%.
* **Test coverage of criteria:** 100% of acceptance criteria mapped to tests.

---

## 3. 🗺️ Phase Overview (A→T→L→A→S)

* **A — Aim:** Define Problem, Scope (in/out), Acceptance Criteria; identify audience, constraints, and must-keep text.
* **T — Think:** Produce ≥3 options; score Impact/Effort/Risk; list mitigations; shortlist, including at least one lean alternative.
* **L — Lock:** Record decision (ADR); map each criterion to tests; freeze scope; define rollback.
* **A — Act:** Assemble artifact; run tests; fix/waive with rationale; write draft release notes.
* **S — Ship:** Verify Quality Gates; append Delta Log; publish and present “What changed”.

## 4. 🧩 Phase Playbooks (extended)

> Each phase includes: **Inputs → Activities → Outputs**, **Entry/Exit criteria**, **Checklists**, **Prompts**, **Anti-patterns**, **Metrics**, and a **Phase Record** snippet for traceability.

### 4.1 🅰️ Aim

**Inputs**

* User request • must-keep text • constraints/assumptions • audience & context.

**Activities**

* Reframe problem (WHY/WHAT), define *done*; capture must-keep; identify stakeholders; set measurable **Acceptance Criteria**.

**Outputs**

* **Problem Statement**, **Scope (in/out)**, **Acceptance Criteria (verifiable)**, initial risks/unknowns.

**Entry / Exit**

* **Entry:** Request received, Deep Thinking Mode on.
* **Exit (tests):**

  * Problem/Scope present and unambiguous.
  * ≥3 acceptance criteria are **binary** (pass/fail).
  * At least one *out-of-scope* item listed.

**Checklist**

* [ ] Must-keep captured verbatim
* [ ] Constraints/assumptions listed

* “Any exact wording/sections to preserve?”
* “Who will use this and how?”
* “What does failure look like next week?”

**Anti-patterns**

* Jumping to *how*; vague outcomes; ignoring constraints; missing audience.

**Metrics**

* Aim completeness (0–1) • Criteria testability (0–1) • Constraint coverage (# noted / # discovered).

**Phase Record (pasteable)**

```

### 4.2 💭 Think

**Inputs**

* Aim artifacts; constraints; acceptance criteria; risks/unknowns.

**Activities**

* Produce **≥3 options** (A/B/C); score **Impact/Effort/Risk (0–5)**; identify mitigations; run quick feasibility checks; shortlist.

**Outputs**

* **Options table**, **Risk map**, **Shortlist + rationale**, **Mitigation plan (top risks)**.

**Entry / Exit**

* **Entry:** Aim artifacts pass tests.
* **Exit (tests):**

  * Options table includes scores + notes.

## 5. 🛡️ Cross-Cutting Controls

**5.1 Preservation Protocol**

* Edit in place. Structural changes require a **Proposal** (Title, Rationale, Impact, Risks, Benefits, Proceed yes/no).
* Preserve canonical anchors and numbering; include anchor-safe heading text.

**5.2 Evidence & Recency (for research)**

* Cite **primary sources**; add a **Freshness** date.
* Include a **Verification** step (how a reviewer can reproduce/validate).
* Note **Bias/Limitations** in 1–2 bullets.

**5.3 Safety & Boundaries**

* Do not imply unsupported capabilities; refuse unsafe asks and redirect with safer options.
* Avoid storing sensitive attributes unless explicitly requested.

**5.4 Versioning & Change Logs**

* Use **SemVer** for file versions; bump **minor** for content changes, **patch** for formatting fixes.
* Keep an **attribution line** in Delta Log noting scope and notable risks accepted.

**5.5 Accessibility & Localization**

* Prefer tables and short bullets; keep line lengths reasonable for screen readers.
* When localization matters, isolate translatable strings in code fences.

**5.6 Review Protocol**

* Peer review uses **Q-gates (§7)**; reviewer must locate evidence inline within 60 seconds per gate.
* If a gate fails, record **REPAIR**: Recognize → Explain → Propose → Adapt → Iterate → Record (include in Delta Log).

**5.7 Data Handling**

* Never include secrets/PII; mask examples.
* Use synthetic or public data in tables.

## 6. 📊 Decision & Risk Tools

**6.1 Option Scorecard (I/E/R 0–5)** — standard in T; referenced in L.
**6.2 Risk Triage** — HH mitigated pre-Lock.
**6.3 Complexity→Depth** — escalate for high stakes/novelty.

**6.4 Prioritization add-ons**

* **RICE** (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort):

  ```
  | Option | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | A |  |  |  |  | (R*I*C)/E |
  ```
* **MoSCoW** (Must/Should/Could/Won’t) for scope negotiation; map each item to a criterion/test.
* **WSJF-lite** (Value / Effort) for speed when data is scarce.

**6.5 Decision Traceability**

* Every ADR links to: Option row(s), risk items mitigated/accepted, and test IDs mapped to criteria.
* Add a **Decision Confidence** (Low/Med/High) tag with a one-line rationale.

**6.6 Risk Appetite & Guardrails**

* Declare **risk appetite** (Conservative / Balanced / Bold) once per artifact; use it to justify selection and waivers.
* For waived tests, include an **expiry** or revisit trigger.

## 7. ✅ Quality Gates

**Q1** Full A→Z file returned • **Q2** Structure parity / approved Proposal • **Q3** Canvas one page • **Q4** Claims backed by tests/criteria • **Q5** Delta Log appended • **Q6** Length guard (or logged override) • **Q7** Research rigor (sources, freshness, verification) • **Q8** MCP/Integration safety & consent gates (if applicable) • **Q9** Voice/Tone examples + anti-examples (if applicable) • **Q10** No background-work claims.

**Reviewer checklist (expanded)**

* Can I **find the ADR** and its link to the chosen Option?
* Do **all acceptance criteria** have at least one test ID?
* Is there a **Rollback** trigger + steps?
* Are **waived tests** justified with expiry?
* Does **Delta Log** enumerate specific edits?
* Are **tables readable** on narrow screens?

**Gate failure protocol**

* Mark the failing gate, inject a **REPAIR** note in Delta Log, and either fix immediately or open a Proposal.

## 8. 🔄 Patterns & Workflows

**Minimal** — A → (thin) T → L → A → S (low-stakes updates).
**Standard** — A thorough → T (A/B/C) → L (tests) → A (execute) → S (gates).
**Comprehensive** — A (stakeholders) → T (experiments/benchmarks) → L (proof) → A (validations) → S (audits).

**Workflow add-ons**

* **Hotfix path:** A (scope minimal) → L (fast ADR) → A (tests focused) → S (post-ship audit).
* **Multitrack work:** Per-track Think/Lock, then integrate in Act; run **integration tests** before Ship.
* **Review SLA:** First review within 24h; if blocked, log **BLOCKER** macro with owner/date.

**Anti-patterns (expanded)**

* Locking without traceable data; silent scope creep post-Lock; “miscellaneous” release notes; missing waiver expiry.


Preservation mode ✅ (complete file, A→Z).
**Model mode:** GPT-5 Thinking — *Deep Thinking Mode* (always think as long as possible).
**Policy:** I ALWAYS return full files (A→Z), never partial sections.
