# Imagician Agent - User Guide v1.4.0

The Imagician Agent transforms natural language into professional image operations, making image editing 10x easier. Through intelligent conversation with customizable thinking depth, it understands WHAT you want to optimize and automatically handles HOW to process it. No modes, no commands, just describe what you need and choose how thorough the optimization should be.

## 🧠 Native Claude Thinking

### How It Works

The system uses native Claude thinking capabilities to plan optimizations. Before executing any operation, it asks:

**"How many rounds of thinking should I use?"**
- **Quick (2-3 rounds)**: Fast processing for simple operations
- **Standard (4-6 rounds)**: Balanced optimization for most tasks
- **Thorough (7+ rounds)**: Best results for complex workflows

### When Thinking Happens

**System ASKS about thinking when:**
- Ready to execute an operation
- All information gathered
- About to create output
- Moving from planning to action

**System SKIPS thinking question when:**
- Still gathering information (file location, format preference)
- In discovery phase (understanding what you want)
- Won't produce output after next response
- Still clarifying requirements

### Thinking Depth Examples

| Task | Recommended | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Simple resize | Quick (2-3) | Straightforward operation |
| Format conversion | Quick (2-3) | Direct conversion |
| Web optimization | Standard (4-6) | Multiple factors to balance |
| Email preparation | Standard (4-6) | Size/quality trade-offs |
| Social media set | Thorough (7+) | Platform-specific needs |
| Batch processing | Standard/Thorough | Consistency vs optimization |
| Responsive images | Thorough (7+) | Multiple size calculations |

.

## 📦 Installing Imagician MCP

The Imagician MCP provides all image processing capabilities with secure, isolated Docker volumes.

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker container for the Imagician Agent MCP tool.

I need to:
1. Create a directory at "$HOME/MCP Servers/mcp-imagician"
2. Set up a Docker container with Node.js and Sharp for image processing
3. Create docker-compose.yml with isolated volume mounts
4. Configure volume mapping: /images with Original/ and New/ folders
5. Update Claude Desktop's configuration at:
   - Mac/Linux: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   - Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
6. Build and start the container

My details:
- Operating system: [Windows/Mac/Linux]
- I want to store images in: [default: $HOME/MCP Servers/mcp-imagician/images]

Please provide:
- Complete Dockerfile with Node.js and Sharp
- docker-compose.yml with /images volume mount only
- Claude Desktop configuration JSON snippet
- Commands to build and run the container
- How to use the Original/ and New/ folders
```

The AI will provide complete setup instructions for your system.

**What Gets Created:**

The setup creates this secure structure:
```
mcp-imagician/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── dist/
│   └── index.js
└── images/
    ├── Original/  ← Place your images here
    └── New/       ← Find processed images here
```

**Quick Reference After Setup:**

```bash
# Start the container
cd ~/MCP\ Servers/mcp-imagician
docker-compose up -d

# Copy images to process
cp ~/Desktop/photo.jpg images/Original/

# In Claude, reference as:
# Input: /images/Original/photo.jpg
# Output: /images/New/photo_processed.jpg

# Check container status
docker ps | grep mcp-imagician

# Restart if needed
docker-compose restart
```

### Option B: NPX Setup (Quick but Less secure)

For quick testing without installation:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imagician": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@flowy11/imagician-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** NPX may have performance issues with large images. Docker is strongly recommended.

### Verifying Installation

**For Docker:**
```bash
# Check container is running
docker ps | grep imagician

# Test image processing libraries
docker exec imagician-mcp node -e "console.log('Sharp:', require('sharp').versions)"

# Check logs
docker logs imagician-mcp

# Verify volume mounts
docker exec imagician-mcp ls -la /images/input
```

**For NPM/NPX:**
```bash
# Check ImageMagick
convert -version

# Check supported formats
identify -list format | grep -E "JPEG|PNG|WebP|AVIF"

# Test with a sample image
convert sample.jpg -quality 85 test.jpg
```

Then restart Claude Desktop and test with: "optimize test image"

.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Can't find image"** | Provide full path like ~/Desktop/photo.jpg |
| **"Format not supported"** | Check if JPEG, PNG, WebP, or AVIF |
| **"Permission denied"** | Check Docker volume permissions |
| **"Quality looks bad"** | Choose "Thorough" thinking for better optimization |
| **"File still too large"** | Try "Thorough" thinking with aggressive compression |
| **"MCP not connected"** | Check Docker container is running |
| **"Out of memory"** | Increase Docker memory allocation |

### Docker-Specific Issues

**Container Problems:**
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps -a | grep imagician

# View detailed logs
docker logs --tail 50 imagician-mcp

# Restart container
docker restart imagician-mcp

# Check resource usage
docker stats imagician-mcp

# Rebuild if needed
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

**Common Docker Fixes:**
- **Memory issues**: Increase Docker Desktop memory to at least 2GB
- **Permission issues**: Ensure volume directories are accessible
- **Large files**: Process in batches or increase memory limit
- **Format issues**: Rebuild container to ensure all libraries installed

### Thinking-Related Issues

**"Why didn't it ask about thinking?"**
- Still in discovery phase
- Gathering information (path, format, etc.)
- Won't produce output yet

**"Can I change thinking depth?"**
- Yes! Just specify: "Use thorough thinking" or "Quick processing please"

**"What if I'm unsure about thinking depth?"**
- Default to Standard (4-6) for most tasks
- The system will suggest based on complexity

### Path Issues

**Correct Path Formats:**
- Use full paths starting with ~ or /
- Escape spaces: `~/My Photos/pic.jpg`
- Common locations:
  - Mac: ~/Pictures/, ~/Desktop/, ~/Downloads/
  - Windows: ~/Pictures/, ~/Desktop/, ~/Documents/
  - Linux: ~/Pictures/, ~/Downloads/, /tmp/

**Image Format Support:**
```bash
# Check supported formats in Docker
docker exec imagician-mcp node -e "console.log(require('sharp').format)"

# Essential formats:
# Input: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, TIFF, SVG
# Output: JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF

# If missing, rebuild Docker container
```

.
