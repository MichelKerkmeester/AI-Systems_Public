## 1. üìä Planning Complexity Assessment

### Complexity Factors

```yaml

    stakeholders:
      low: 1-2
      medium: 3-5
      high: >5
    user_stories:
      low: <5
      medium: 5-12
      high: >12
    acceptance_criteria:
      low: <10
      medium: 10-25
      high: >25

  technical:
    architectural_decisions:
      low: <3
      medium: 3-7
      high: >7
    integration_points:
      low: 0-2
      medium: 3-6
      high: >6
    new_technologies:
      low: 0
      medium: 1-2
      high: >2

  constraints:
    regulatory_compliance:
      none: 0
      moderate: 1-2
      strict: >2
    performance_requirements:
      basic: standard_perf
      demanding: high_perf
      critical: real_time
    security_level:
      standard: basic_auth
      elevated: encryption
      critical: zero_trust
```

### Planning Complexity Score

```python
def calculate_planning_complexity(factors):
    weights = {
        'stakeholders': 0.15,
        'user_stories': 0.15,
        'acceptance_criteria': 0.10,
        'architectural_decisions': 0.20,
        'integration_points': 0.15,
        'new_technologies': 0.10,
        'compliance': 0.10,
        'security_level': 0.05
    }

    score = 0
    for factor, value in factors.items():
        if value in ['low', 'none', 'basic', 'standard', 0] or value < thresholds[factor].low:
            points = 1
        elif value in ['medium', 'moderate', 'demanding', 'elevated'] or value < thresholds[factor].medium:
            points = 2
        else:
            points = 3
        score += points * weights[factor]

    return score * 33.33  # Normalize to 0-100
```

.

## 2. üîç Requirement Clarity Assessment

### Clarity Indicators

```yaml
clarity_indicators:
  specification:
    goal_clarity:
      clear: well_defined_objectives
      unclear: vague_objectives
      ambiguous: conflicting_objectives

    scope_definition:
      clear: explicit_boundaries
      fuzzy: implicit_boundaries
      undefined: no_boundaries

    success_metrics:
      defined: measurable_kpis
      partial: qualitative_only
      missing: no_metrics

  constraints:
    known_constraints:
      complete: all_identified
      partial: some_identified
      unknown: discovery_needed

    priorities:
      clear: ranked_by_value
      unclear: all_high_priority
      conflicting: contradictory
```

### Clarity Score Calculation

```python
def calculate_clarity(indicators):
    weights = {
        'goal_clarity': 0.30,
        'scope_definition': 0.25,
        'success_metrics': 0.20,
        'known_constraints': 0.15,
        'priorities': 0.10
    }

    score = 0
    for indicator, value in indicators.items():
        if value in ['clear', 'defined', 'complete']:
            points = 3
        elif value in ['fuzzy', 'partial', 'unclear']:
            points = 2
        else:
            points = 1
        score += points * weights[indicator]

    return (score / 3) * 100  # Normalize to 0-100
```

## 5. üîÑ Dynamic Adjustments

### Runtime Monitoring

```python
class PlanningMonitor:
    def adjust_strategy(self, metrics):
        if metrics.ambiguity_count > 5:
            self.add_clarification_round()

        if metrics.stakeholder_conflicts > 2:
            self.add_alignment_session()

        if metrics.risk_count > 10:
            self.increase_risk_analysis_depth()

        if metrics.dependency_cycles_found:
            self.add_architecture_review()
```

### Progressive Refinement

   ‚Üì (conflicting perspectives)
2. Sequential with Reconciliation
   ‚Üì (clarity issues)
3. Discovery + Iterative Planning
   ‚Üì (stakeholder misalignment)
4. Phased Consensus Building
   ‚Üì (too complex)
5. Break into Sub-plans

## 7. üöÄ Optimization Rules

### Planning Workflow Optimization

```python
def optimize_planning_workflow(context):
    # Assess planning needs
    complexity = calculate_complexity(context)
    clarity = calculate_clarity(context)

    # Select optimal workflow
    if clarity > 70 and complexity < 40:
        return 'streamlined_planning'
    elif clarity < 40:
        return 'discovery_first'
    elif complexity > 70:
        return 'phased_detailed_planning'
    else:
        return 'standard_parallel'
```

### Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

```python
def optimize_stakeholder_engagement(stakeholders):
    strategy = {
        'high_involvement': [],
        'review_approval': [],
        'keep_informed': []
    }

    for sh in stakeholders:
        if sh.decision_authority or sh.domain_expert:
            strategy['high_involvement'].append(sh)
        elif sh.approval_required:
            strategy['review_approval'].append(sh)
        else:
            strategy['keep_informed'].append(sh)

    return strategy
```

.

## 11. üéØ YAML ADAPTIVE RULES MAPPING

This section maps the YAML `adaptive_rules` fields from `sk_p__spec_plan.yaml` to concrete workflow behaviors.

### Rule: high_complexity

**YAML Configuration**:
```yaml
high_complexity:
  concurrency: 2
  review_depth: exhaustive
```

**Triggers**:
- Large spec folder (>10 files)
- Complex requirements (>50 acceptance criteria)
- Multiple integration points (>5 external systems)
- High technical complexity (planning_complexity_score > 70)

**Adaptations Applied**:
- **Reduce Concurrency**: `3 ‚Üí 2` parallel agents (fewer simultaneous executions)
- **Increase Review Depth**: `standard ‚Üí exhaustive` (more thorough validation)
- **Add Checkpoints**: Insert intermediate validation between parallel blocks
- **Extended Timeouts**: Allow more time for complex agent processing

**Impact**:
- **Execution Time**: Longer (reduced parallelism)
- **Quality**: Higher (exhaustive review catches more issues)
- **Resource Usage**: Lower peak usage (fewer concurrent agents)

---

### Rule: high_uncertainty

**YAML Configuration**:
```yaml
high_uncertainty:
  insert: discovery_microstep_before_parallel_blocks
  estimates: use_ranges
```

**Triggers**:
- Ambiguous requirements in spec.md
- Missing critical context
- Contradictory information in artifacts
- Requirement clarity score < 60
- New domain or unfamiliar technology

**Adaptations Applied**:
- **Insert Discovery Phase**: Add microstep BEFORE parallel blocks to clarify unknowns
- **Use Estimate Ranges**: Replace point estimates with min-max ranges
- **Flag Uncertainty Areas**: Explicitly mark unclear sections for user review
- **Iterative Refinement**: Enable progressive clarification loops

**Impact**:
- **Execution Time**: Additional clarification pass adds time
- **Accuracy**: More conservative estimates reduce over-commitment
- **Risk Mitigation**: Discovery phase prevents wasted parallel effort

---

### Rule: parallel_not_supported

**YAML Configuration**:
```yaml
parallel_not_supported:
  concurrency: 1
  note: "If parallel sub-agents unsupported, run tasks one-by-one; keep review and synthesis."
```

**Triggers**:
- Environment limitations (single-threaded execution environment)
- API rate limits preventing concurrent requests
- Context window constraints (insufficient memory for parallel agents)
- System resources exhausted

**Adaptations Applied**:
- **Reduce to Sequential**: `concurrency ‚Üí 1` (all agents run one-by-one)
- **Preserve Phases**: Keep review and synthesis phases intact
- **Extend Timeouts**: Account for sequential execution duration
- **Simplified Monitoring**: Reduce overhead of parallel coordination

**Impact**:
- **Execution Time**: Significantly longer (3-4x sequential vs parallel)
- **Quality**: Same (review/synthesis phases preserved)
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal (single agent at a time)

- Involve stakeholders early
- Document assumptions explicitly
- Consider alternatives
- Define success metrics

### DON'T:

- Ignore constraints
- Over-commit on timelines
- Leave risks unmitigated
- Assume requirements are static

### ALWAYS:

- Validate understanding
- Document decisions and rationale
