## 📝 Prompts

<a id="1-effective-gpt"></a>
#### 1. 💬 Effective GPT

System instructions for direct, efficient AI communication without filler.

-

**Core Communication Principles**:
  - Eliminates emojis, filler, hype, and conversational transitions
  - Blunt, directive phrasing focused on cognitive clarity
  - No engagement-boosting or sentiment-softening behaviors
  - Immediate termination after information delivery

**Session Isolation & Privacy**:
  - Each conversation treated as new user
  - No continuity between sessions
  - No memory of past interactions
  - Dutch exception: Softened rules with je/u formality

.

## ✏️ Writer Systems

<a id="2-product-owner-writer"></a>
#### 2. 📋 Product Owner Writer

Create professional dev tickets, PRDs, and enhanced documentation with automatic complexity scaling.

-

**Intelligent Modes & Auto-Scaling**:
  - Modes: $ticket & $prd (dev work), $doc (guides/formatting), $interactive (discovery), $quick (instant)
  - Auto-complexity for tickets: Simple (2-3), Standard (4-5), Complex (6-8 sections)

**DEPTH Framework & Silent Processing**:
  - 5-phase thinking with 10 rounds automatic (user doesn't control)
  - All processing happens silently behind simple messages
  - $quick mode: Zero waiting, 1-5 rounds auto-scaled

.

<a id="3-prompt-engineering-assistant"></a>
#### 3. 🎯 Prompt Engineering Assistant

Create effective AI prompts using 7 specialized frameworks, systematic evaluation, and transparent DEPTH processing.

-

**Modes & Output Formats**:
  - **Core Modes**: $interactive (DEFAULT), $improve, $refine, $quick, $short
  - **Format Options**: Standard/Markdown (baseline), JSON (+5-10% tokens), YAML (+3-7% tokens)
  - **Artifact Delivery**: All enhancements as reusable artifacts with minimal headers
  - **Complexity Management**: Auto framework selection (1-4 RCAF), choice offered (5-6), simplification challenge (7+)
  - **Pattern Library**: 20+ enhancement patterns (vague→specific, assumption elimination, etc.)  

**DEPTH Thinking & Prompt frameworks**:
  - **DEPTH Framework**: Discover → Engineer → Prototype → Test → Harmonize
  - **Transparent Reporting**: Shows improvements, CLEAR before/after, framework reasoning
  - **RCAF** (92% success): Default for 80% of prompts - Role, Context, Action, Format
  - **COSTAR** (94%): Content creation - Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response
  - **RACE** (88%): Urgent tasks - Role, Action, Context, Execute
  - **CRAFT** (91%): Complex projects - Context, Role, Action, Format, Target
  - **TIDD-EC** (93%): Precision-critical - Task, Instructions, Do's, Don'ts, Examples, Context
  - **CIDI** (90%): Process documentation - Context, Instructions, Details, Input
  - **CRISPE** (87%): Strategy/exploration - Capacity, Insight, Statement, Personality, Experiment
  - **CLEAR Evaluation**: 5 dimensions (Correctness, Logic, Expression, Arrangement, Reuse)
  - Target scores: 40+/50 standard, 45+/50 excellence

## 🧪 Dev Systems

<a id="4-gpt-5-pro"></a>
#### 4. 🧠 GPT 5 Pro

Project for GPT 5 Pro that simulates a complete dev environment with AGENTS.md, Knowledge Base, and Spec Kit workflows.

---

**Guardrails & Compliance**:
  - STOP - READ AGENTS.md FIRST; code_standards.md is law
  - Confidence gating (<80% → clarify), scope discipline, evidence > assumptions
  - Full files only (line 1 → EOF) with path header; no snippets/diffs
  - Attachments (⬇️) primary; Canvas (📝) optional (recommended >200 lines)

**Workflow & Numbered Deliverables**:
  - Spec → Plan → Tasks → Analysis → Implementation → Summary
  - Sequential numbering: 001, 002a, 003…

.

<a id="5-dev-workflows"></a>
#### 5. 📜 DEV Workflows

Systematic development workflows with Github SpecKit integration for reliable development.

-

**Development Workflows**:
  - **Multiple Execution Modes**: Manual (full approvals), Automated (critical-only), etc.
  - Operating modes: Standard, Investigation, Hotfix, Performance (Varies per Prompt)
  - Progressive task checklists with validation checkpoints
  - Specialized prompt for extracting context to apply in various workflows.

**Code Review & Debugger**:
  - **Debug-Test-Review Workflow**: Understand → Investigate → Debug → Fix → Test → Review
  - Chrome DevTools MCP integration for browser-based debugging
  - Evidence-based approach: Never assumes, validates everything with MCP tools
  - Mandatory staging verification before approval
