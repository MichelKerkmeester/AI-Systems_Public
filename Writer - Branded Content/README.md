## Overview

This is a flexible content creation system currently configured for Product Designers who want to share their design process, case studies, and professional insights. The same system can be reconfigured for:
- **Specific Brands**: Adapt the voice to match your company's tone and values
- **Different Professions**: Marketing, engineering, education, healthcare, finance, etc.

Built on principles of team credit, failure acknowledgment, and continuous learning, it combines systematic excellence with genuine authenticity through 8 interconnected documents that provide contextual enrichment while maintaining absolute user autonomy.

.

## ‚ú® Core Philosophy

### The Professional Voice Trinity
Every piece of content maintains these principles:
- **Knowledgeable**: Deep expertise without arrogance
- **Curious**: Still learning and asking questions  
- **Empowering**: Enable others to build better

### Process Transparency
Real work is messy. Content should reflect that:
- Show iterations: "Took 3 attempts before it worked"
- Include failures: "This approach failed because..."
- Credit team: "Sarah spotted the issue"
- Express uncertainty: "Still not sure why this works..."

### User Autonomy (v5.1.2)
Complete control maintained at all times:
- **All Questions Asked**: Never skips based on patterns
- **All Options Shown**: Every choice always available
- **Historical Context**: Displayed as notes, never restrictions
- **No Automation**: User decides everything

### Artifact Formatting Standards
All content artifacts include:
- **AI System Header**: Always appears above artifact details
- **Bottom Placement**: Details at bottom with dash bullets
- **Vertical Formatting**: Clean, organized structure
- **Complete Metadata**: Framework, mode, tone, thinking rounds

## üß† ATLAS/DEPTH Thinking Framework

### User-Controlled Depth (Always Asked)
Before creating any content, the system ALWAYS asks:
```
How many rounds of thinking would help here? (1-10)

Based on your request, I'm thinking: 4 rounds
‚Ä¢ Complexity: Medium - multiple concepts
‚Ä¢ Audience: Clear - designers
‚Ä¢ Depth needed: Moderate - actionable detail

[Historical note: You typically choose 4 rounds for similar content]

Your choice? (All options 1-10 available)
```

### Thinking Rounds Guide
| Rounds | Use For | DEPTH Phases | Challenge Mode | Context |
|--------|---------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| 1-2 | Quick edits | D‚ÜíH | No | Previous shown |
| 3-5 | Standard content | D‚ÜíE‚ÜíP‚ÜíH | Gentle | History noted |
| 6-7 | Complex narratives | D‚ÜíE‚ÜíP‚ÜíT‚ÜíH | Moderate | Patterns displayed |
| 8-10 | Strategic analyses | Full DEPTH | Strong | Full context |

### Challenge Mode Examples
At 3+ rounds, system challenges complexity:
```
Quick thought before we dive deep:
Could we achieve your goal with:
- Single insight vs full framework?
- One example vs multiple cases?
- Direct lesson vs detailed analysis?

[Historical note: Challenge acceptance rate: 75%]
All options remain available - your choice?
