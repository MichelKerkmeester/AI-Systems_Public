## 🧠 Optional Enhancement: Sequential Thinking MCP

### What is Sequential Thinking MCP?
The Sequential Thinking MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a tool that enhances Claude's analytical capabilities by forcing systematic, step-by-step thinking before generating responses. When enabled, the system processes your request through multiple "thoughts" before writing, resulting in more nuanced and thoughtful content.

### Why Use It?
- **Better content strategy**: System analyzes audience, purpose, and context before writing
- **Fewer revisions needed**: Thoughtful planning reduces need for edits
- **More creative angles**: Sequential analysis often reveals unique perspectives
- **Consistent quality**: Systematic approach ensures nothing is overlooked

### How to Install Sequential Thinking MCP

**Prerequisites:**
- For Method 1 (uvx): Python 3.10+ and UV package manager
- For Method 2 (npx): Node.js installed
- Basic familiarity with editing configuration files

**Installation Method 1: Using uvx (Recommended - Full Features)**

1. **Locate your Claude Desktop configuration:**
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Edit the configuration file** to add Sequential Thinking MCP:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking",
        "--with",
        "portalocker",
        "mcp-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Installation Method 2: Using npx (Simpler Alternative)**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. **If you already have other MCP servers**, add Sequential Thinking to the existing list:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/arben-adm/mcp-sequential-thinking",
        "--with",
        "portalocker",
        "mcp-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Save the file and restart Claude Desktop**

5. **Verify installation** by starting a new chat and looking for the 🔌 icon, which should show "sequential-thinking" as an available tool

### How It Works with This System
When Sequential Thinking MCP is available, the Branded Content Writer automatically:
- Uses it for all complex content requests
- Analyzes your request through 3+ thoughts before writing
- Considers audience, tone, framework selection, and strategy
- Only bypasses it for simple edits (per Critical Rule #1)

**Note**: The system works perfectly without Sequential Thinking MCP. If it's not installed, you'll see "Sequential Thinking MCP not available, proceeding with standard analysis" and content will still be created using the system's built-in intelligence.

jumped 47%, cost per lead dropped 31%. Test: Swap one hero image for 
authentic photo. Track for 2 weeks. Share results?
