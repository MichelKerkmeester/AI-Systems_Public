## 1. 🔴 CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES

### ⚠️ MANDATORY FORMATTING - NEVER SKIP

**EVERY artifact MUST follow this EXACT formatting:**

```markdown
## Variations

---

### Most concise:

**Version 1**

---

**Headline —**
[Content goes here on its own line]

**Body —**
[Content goes here on its own line]

**CTA —**
[Content goes here on its own line]

---

**Version 2**

---

**Headline —**
[Content goes here on its own line]

**Body —**
[Content goes here on its own line]

**CTA —**
[Content goes here on its own line]

---

[Continue pattern...]
```

### 🚨 NON-NEGOTIABLE FORMATTING RULES

| **Rule** | **ALWAYS DO** | **NEVER DO** |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Labels** | **Bold labels with em dash (Headline —, Body —, etc.)** | **Plain text (Headline —, Body —)** |
| **Line Breaks** | **Empty line after EVERY em dash (—)** | Put content on same line as label |
| **Dividers** | `---` between EVERY version | Skip dividers |
| **Version Headers** | `**Version X**` (NO EM DASH) then TWO empty lines then `---` | `**Version X —**` with em dash |
| **Element Format** | `**Label —**` then IMMEDIATE line break | `**Label —** content` on same line |
| **Between Elements** | One empty line between each element | No spacing or too much spacing |
| **Between Versions** | `---` divider after last element | No separation between versions |
| **Category Headers** | `### Category:` with line break | `###Category:` without space |
| **Main Header** | `## Variations` then empty line then `---` | Skip header divider |

### CRITICAL: Label and Content Separation

```markdown
✅ CORRECT FORMAT:

**Headline —**
Components ready. Tokens documented.

**Body —**
Ship faster with tested patterns.

❌ WRONG FORMAT:

**Headline —** Components ready. Tokens documented.
**Body —** Ship faster with tested patterns.
```

### CRITICAL: Version Header Format

```markdown
✅ CORRECT VERSION HEADER:

**Version 1**

---

❌ WRONG VERSION HEADER:

**Version 1 —**

---
```

### Correct Format Example (EXACT TEMPLATE):

```markdown
## Variations

---

### Most concise:

**Version 1**

---

**Headline —**
Skip 3 months of building

**Body —**
€50K saved with proper design systems.

**CTA —**
Get the blueprint →

---

**Version 2**

---

**Headline —**
Design to code. Automated.

**Body —**
Figma changes = instant updates.

**CTA —**
Try it now

| Single artifact delivery | Mix artifact and response | Professional output |
| **Bold labels with em dash** | **Plain text labels** | **Design consistency** |
| **Version headers WITHOUT em dash** | **Version headers WITH em dash** | **Correct formatting** |
| **Line break after every '—'** | **Content on same line** | **Readability** |
| **Dividers between all versions** | **Run versions together** | Proper structure |
| Details at BOTTOM | Place details at top/middle | Standard format |
| Subtle AI System footer | Large AI System section | Minimal footprint |
| Line breaks between elements | Run elements together | Clear spacing |
| 3/2/1 variations per group | Wrong variation count | Accurate scaling |
| **Document ATLAS application** | Hide thinking depth | Transparency |

### Medium Form Example with ATLAS (6 Versions Total)

```markdown
CONTENT: Design process transparency article

---

## Variations

---

### Most concise:

**Version 1**

---

**Subject —**
How 3 iterations saved €200K

**Body —**
Failed twice. Learned everything. Third design reduced support tickets by 78%. Process transparency meant stakeholder buy-in. No hiding failures, just showing progress. Real metrics: 3 sprints, €200K saved, team celebrated.

---

**Version 2**

---

**Subject —**
Our design system journey (spoiler: messy)

**Body —**
Figma components everywhere. No documentation. Devs frustrated. Started over with tokens. Built incrementally. Now: 72% reuse rate, 50% faster shipping, actual consistency. Not perfect, still iterating.

---

### Most valuable:

**Version 1**

---

**Subject —**
Your design process could save €50K quarterly

**Body —**
We thought our process was fine. Then we measured: 60% rework, 3-week cycles, stakeholder confusion. Changed approach: daily design reviews, shared Figma files, developer pairing. Result: 2-week sprints, 80% first-time approval, €200K annual savings. Process transparency was the key. Show your work, show your iterations, show your failures. Teams trust honesty over perfection.

---

**Version 2**

---

**Subject —**
31% of teams measure design ROI. Here's how we joined them.

**Body —**
Design impact was invisible. No metrics, no budget. Started tracking: task completion rates, support tickets, development time. Implemented design system: 72% component reuse. Measured everything: 200 dev hours saved monthly. €50K quarterly impact documented. CFO approved 3 new hires. ROI tracking changed everything.

---

### Most authentic:

**Version 1**

---

**Subject —**
Honestly, our process was backwards (here's what we changed)

**Body —**
Designers designing in isolation. Developers getting PDFs. Stakeholders surprised by outcomes. Sound familiar? We flipped it: developers in design reviews, PMs in user testing, everyone in Figma. Messy at first. Now shipping weekly. Not revolutionary, just collaborative.

---

**Version 2**

---

**Subject —**
We wasted 6 months on the wrong problem

**Body —**
Thought users needed more features. Built everything. Usage dropped. Finally did user research (yeah, we know). Real problem: navigation. Three iterations later: 78% task success. Lesson learned: test assumptions early. Failure teaches more than success.
