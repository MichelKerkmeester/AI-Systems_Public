## 9. üöÄ Strategic Positioning

### Core Positioning with Proper Copy Format

**One-Line:** "Design that ships, not just looks good."

**Elevator Pitch:** "We help teams build products users love through transparent process, real collaboration, and measurable impact. From discovery to delivery in weeks, not months. Process transparency builds trust, iterations drive quality."

[VERIFY ALL NUMBERS BEFORE USING - MANDATORY]

### Positioning Hierarchy (Formatted for Copy Use)

When creating copy from these, remember **3/2/1 variations per group based on word count** with **proper formatting**:

**Level 1 (Awareness) - Short Form Example (1-30 words):**
```markdown
## Variations

### Most concise:

**Version 1:** Ship designs that work, not just look good

---

**Version 2:** Real process, real results, real impact

---

**Version 3:** From concept to code in 2 weeks [VERIFY]

---

### Most valuable:

**Version 1:** 3 iterations. 78% success. Proven process. [VERIFY]

---

**Version 2:** Save ‚Ç¨50K with better design decisions [VERIFY]

---

**Version 3:** Figma to production, no handoff hell

---

### Most authentic:

**Version 1:** We failed twice before succeeding (worth it)

---

**Version 2:** Your team already knows the answer

---

**Version 3:** Design is messy. Ship anyway.
```

[Note: Verify specific numbers before using - MANDATORY]

**Level 2 (Consideration) - Medium Form Example (31-150 words):**
```markdown
## Variations

### Most concise:

**Version 1:** Design systems that actually work. 72% component reuse [VERIFY]. 200 dev hours saved monthly [VERIFY]. No more "that's not the design" arguments. Figma to code, automated. Process transparency means stakeholder trust.

---

**Version 2:** Stop measuring outputs, measure outcomes. Task completion up 78% [VERIFY]. Support tickets down 60% [VERIFY]. Development time halved. Real metrics from real projects. ROI documented and proven.

---

### Most valuable:

**Version 1:** Transform your design process in 3 sprints. Week 1: Audit current state, identify gaps. Week 2: Implement quick wins, measure baseline. Week 3: Scale what works, kill what doesn't. Result: 50% faster delivery [VERIFY], 80% stakeholder satisfaction [VERIFY], ‚Ç¨200K annual savings [VERIFY]. Process transparency was key. Show work, show iterations, show impact.

---

**Version 2:** Your designers cost ‚Ç¨150K annually [VERIFY]. Are they delivering ‚Ç¨1.5M value? Only 31% of teams know [VERIFY]. Start measuring: task completion, support reduction, development efficiency. Implement design system: 72% reuse rate standard [VERIFY]. Track everything: before/after metrics essential. Result: Provable ROI, justified headcount, sustained investment.
```

## 10. üìç Copy Formulas & Intelligence

### Proven Copy Patterns (Apply with 3/2/1 Variations)

**ALWAYS VERIFY DATA BEFORE APPLYING FORMULAS - MANDATORY**

**Process Transparency:**
"Took [verify iterations] to get [verify success rate]. Here's what worked: [specific learning]."
Example: "3 iterations to 78% task success. User testing revealed navigation issues." [VERIFY BOTH]

**Tool Reality:**
"[Verify tool] has [verify percentage] market share. Here's why: [verify key reason]."
Example: "Figma at 72% because real-time collaboration is non-negotiable." [VERIFY]

**Team Success:**
"Our [role] and [role] collaborated on [verify outcome]. [Specific contribution] made the difference."
Example: "Designers and developers paired. 50% fewer implementation bugs resulted." [VERIFY]

**Career Growth:**
"From [verify starting salary] to [verify end salary] in [verify timeframe]. Path: [specific steps]."
Example: "‚Ç¨100K to ‚Ç¨180K in 4 years. Key: learned React, led design system." [VERIFY ALL]

**ROI Story:**
"‚Ç¨[verify amount] saved through [specific design decision]. Measured by: [verify metric]."
Example: "‚Ç¨200K saved via simplified onboarding. Support tickets down 78%." [VERIFY BOTH]

**Pain Agitation:**
"Still [verify pain point]? Industry average is [verify stat]. We achieved [better result]."
Example: "Still can't measure ROI? 69% can't. We track everything from day 1." [VERIFY]

### Intelligence Integration for Copy

### Intelligence Scaling with Verification (Async)
```python
async def scale_intelligence(thinking_rounds: int, word_count: int) -> tuple:
    # Determine stat usage

        intelligence = 'single_killer_stat'  # "Figma 72%"
        stats_to_verify = ['tool_share']  # MANDATORY
    elif thinking_rounds <= 5:

### Challenge Mode for Intelligence (Always at 6+ Rounds)
- 3+ stats? ‚Üí "Which one is strongest?" [Verify strongest - **MANDATORY**]
- Comparison heavy? ‚Üí "Focus on our value?" [Verify our value - **MANDATORY**]
- Multiple pain points? ‚Üí "Lead with biggest?" [Verify biggest pain - **MANDATORY**]
- Complex positioning? ‚Üí "Simpler message?" [Use verified simple stat - **MANDATORY**]
- Too many variations? ‚Üí "Focus on quality over quantity?"
- Process heavy? ‚Üí "One example enough?" [Pick best verified - **MANDATORY**]
