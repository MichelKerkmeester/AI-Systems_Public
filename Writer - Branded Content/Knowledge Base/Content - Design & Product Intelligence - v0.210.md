#### Verification & Fallback Process
```python
def verify_before_use(stat_type: str, stored_value: any) -> tuple:
    """Always verify before using in copy"""
    
    # Step 1: Execute web search
    search_result = web_search(verification_queries[stat_type])
    
    # Step 2: Parse and compare
    current_value = parse_search_result(search_result)
    
    # Step 3: Decision logic
    if current_value and significant_change(stored_value, current_value):
        # Use updated value
        value_to_use = current_value
        verification_note = f"Updated from {stored_value} to {current_value}"
    elif current_value:
        # Confirmed still accurate
        value_to_use = stored_value
        verification_note = "Verified current"
    else:
        # Use fallback language (no specific numbers)
        value_to_use = fallback_language[stat_type]
        verification_note = "Using general language"
    
    # Step 4: Convert to EUR if currency
    if is_currency(value_to_use) and not in_eur(value_to_use):
        value_to_use = convert_to_eur(value_to_use)
    
    return value_to_use, verification_note
```
