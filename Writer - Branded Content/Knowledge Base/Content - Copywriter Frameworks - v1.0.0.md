## 1. ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE

Frameworks guide content creation but don't dictate it. Apply based on goal, not keywords:
- "problem" ≠ automatic PATH framework
- "story" ≠ automatic CASE framework
- "question" ≠ automatic QPT framework
- "process" ≠ automatic detailed documentation
- "insight" ≠ automatic SVC framework

**Simple edits bypass framework selection entirely.**
**Professional knowledge enhances framework application when methodology, principles, or practices matter.**
**ATLAS thinking phases determine framework complexity.**
**Challenge Mode may suggest cleaner frameworks.**
**Pattern Learning adapts framework selection over time.**
**Always provide multiple versions based on content length (see section 14).**

    base_framework = determine_by_goal(goal)
    
    if session_patterns:
        # Check success rate of frameworks
        if session_patterns.framework_success[base_framework] < 0.5:
            return suggest_alternative(base_framework)
        
        # Apply user's proven preferences
        if session_patterns.framework_preference:
            return session_patterns.framework_preference
        
        # Adjust for challenge acceptance

"Our tooltips kept breaking on mobile (flexbox issue)"
"Grid's implicit flow handles edge cases flexbox can't"
"Try this maybe: display: grid; place-items: center;"

Challenge-Applied (if accepted):
"Tooltip broke. Grid fixed it. Try place-items: center."

Pattern Note: [Tracking if simpler versions work better]
Session Count: [Number of SVC uses]
```

**QPT** → Question • Perspective • Takeaway
```
Standard:
"Should designers code?"
"From what we've seen, understanding constraints helps"

Challenge Check: "Could we just pose the question?"

Alternative (if challenge accepted):
"Should designers code? What's worked for your team?"

Pattern Note: [User preference for structure recorded]
Effectiveness: [Tracking engagement metrics]
```

**TIP** → Trigger • Insight • Practice
```
Standard:
"When stakeholders say 'make it pop'"
"They usually mean visual hierarchy isn't clear (we think)"
"Try: Increase contrast ratios by 2x"

Knowledge-Enhanced:
"When users skip your primary CTA"

## 8. 🎯 KNOWLEDGE-INFORMED CONTENT PATTERNS

**Enhanced with DEPTH thinking, Pattern Learning, and Challenge Integration:**

| Content Type | Knowledge Integration | Framework | Focus | DEPTH | Pattern Track | Challenge |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------|--------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| Design decision | "Gestalt principles suggest..." | SVC + context | Reasoning | D→H | Success rate | "Skip theory?" |
| Process improvement | "Lean UX methodology shows..." | PATH + data | Efficiency | D→E→P→H | Acceptance | "One method?" |

- "Would mentioning the principle be enough?"
- "Could one methodology example work?"
- "Is the full framework helping or adding complexity?"

### Pattern-Based Knowledge Selection 
```python
def select_knowledge_depth(patterns):
    if patterns.prefers_light_theory:
        return minimal_principles()
    elif patterns.values_examples:
        return example_heavy()
    else:
        return balanced_approach()
```

        if challenge_accepted() or patterns.prefers_simple:
            return reduce_framework_complexity(original)
    return original
```

## 11. 🔄 PATTERN LEARNING FOR FRAMEWORKS

### Session Framework Tracking
```python
class FrameworkPatterns:
    def __init__(self):
        self.usage = {
            'SVC': {'count': 0, 'success': 0, 'variations': []},
            'CASE': {'count': 0, 'success': 0, 'depth_preference': None},
            'QPT': {'count': 0, 'success': 0, 'engagement_style': None},
            # ... all frameworks
        }
        
        self.preferences = {
            'simplification_rate': 0.0,
            'preferred_complexity': None,
            'tone_framework_pairs': {},
            'audience_framework_match': {},
            'challenge_acceptance': 0.0,
            'version_preference': {}  # Track which versions resonate
        }
        
        self.evolution = {
            'stage': 'learning',  # learning/suggesting/adapting/optimized
            'confidence': 0.0,
            'last_adjustment': None
        }
```

### Learning Triggers We've Noticed
- After 3 uses of same framework → Note preference
- After 2 simplifications → Default to simple (but offer complex)
- After pattern success → Strengthen preference
- After pattern failure → Suggest alternative
- After 5 consistent choices → Strong default (but always show options)
- **After version selection pattern → Note preferred quantity**

### Adaptive Framework Selection
```
First request: Full framework analysis
Second similar: "Use CASE like before?"
Third similar: Auto-select with note (but show all options)
Fifth+: Pattern established (but can always change)
Tenth+: Predictive optimization (all frameworks still available)
```

### Progressive Learning Stages

| Stage | Requests | What Happens | Example |
|-------|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Learning** | 1-3 | Track usage | Note which frameworks chosen |
| **Suggesting** | 4-6 | Soft guidance | "CASE worked well last time" |
| **Adapting** | 7-9 | Adjust defaults | Pre-select successful framework |
| **Optimized** | 10+ | Predictive | Auto-optimize framework choice |

## 12. 🚨 LEARN PROTOCOL FOR FRAMEWORKS

### Framework Error Recovery

**L - Locate**
```
Framework not resonating
Pattern: [Previous framework issues noted]
Impact: [Message clarity/engagement/learning]
Version count: [Check if appropriate for length]
```

**E - Explain**
```
"CASE seems too long for LinkedIn" 
or
"SVC might be missing needed depth"
or
"Not enough variations for short content"
Previous pattern: [You seem to prefer X for platform Y]
```

**A - Alternatives**
```
Three framework options:
1. Switch to SVC (simpler) - [matches simplification pattern]
2. Shorten CASE (hybrid) - [balanced approach]
3. Continue full (original) - [if depth needed]
4. Add more versions - [if short-form content]

Based on patterns: Option [X] might work best
```

**R - Refine**
```
Apply selected framework
Adjust complexity level
Maintain key elements
Update pattern tracking
Ensure correct version count
```

**N - Note**
```
Framework preference recorded: [framework]
Platform pairing noted: [platform-framework]
Version preference noted: [quantity]
Future default: [new approach]
Prevention: [automatic selection]
```

### Common Framework Repairs

**Wrong Complexity:**
```
L: Framework too complex for request
E: Over-structured for simple insight
A: 1. Switch to SVC (simple)
   2. Use TIP (micro)
   3. Direct statement (no framework)
R: [Apply based on pattern]
N: Complexity threshold noted
```

**Missing Depth:**
```
L: Framework too simple for need
E: SVC insufficient for case study
A: 1. Upgrade to CASE
   2. Add PATH elements
   3. Hybrid approach
R: [Apply selected]
N: Depth requirement recorded
```

**Insufficient Versions:**
```
L: Only 1 version for short-form content
E: Need 3 versions per variation for short content
A: 1. Generate additional versions
   2. Vary angle/emphasis
   3. Different opening/closing
R: Create multiple versions
N: Version quantity rule applied
```

## 13. 📊 FRAMEWORK EMERGENCY KIT

### Quick Framework Selector (When Patterns Unclear)
```python
# When patterns unavailable or unclear
def emergency_framework_select(content_type):
    emergency_map = {
        'insight': 'SVC',
        'story': 'CASE',
        'question': 'QPT',
        'process': 'PATH',
        'tutorial': 'HELP',
        'reflection': 'FAIL',
        'comparison': 'COMPARE',
        'tip': 'TIP'
    }
    return emergency_map.get(content_type, 'SVC')
```

### Framework Combinations (Sometimes These Work)
- **SVC + QPT** = Insight with discussion
- **CASE + PATH** = Story with process
- **HELP + TIP** = Tutorial with quick wins
- **FAIL + QPT** = Reflection with questions

### Challenge Mode Defaults
- 1-2 rounds: No challenge
- 3-4 rounds: Gentle challenge
- 5-6 rounds: Moderate challenge
- 7+ rounds: Strong challenge

### Pattern Recognition Shortcuts
- 3 same frameworks = Preference might be established
- 2 simplifications = Simplicity bias likely
- 5 successful uses = Framework probably locked
- 2 failures = Alternative might help
- **3 version selections = Quantity preference noted**

---

## 14. 📍 VARIATION QUANTITY RULES

### CRITICAL RULE: Content Length Determines Version Count

The system provides different numbers of versions based on content length to give users maximum options for short copy and focused options for longer pieces.

### Version Quantity Formula

```python
def determine_version_count(content_length):
    """
    Determines how many versions to create per variation group
    based on content length
    """
    if content_length <= 1_paragraph:  # Short form
        return 3  # 3 versions each for practical/insightful/collaborative = 9 total
    elif content_length <= 5_paragraphs:  # Medium form
        return 2  # 2 versions each = 6 total
    else:  # Long form
        return 1  # 1 version each = 3 total (standard)
```

### Short Form (1 paragraph or less)
**3 versions per variation group = 9 total options**

### Pattern Tracking for Versions

```python
class VersionPatterns:
    def __init__(self):
        self.preferences = {
            'short_form': {
                'practical_preference': None,  # Which of 3 practical
                'insightful_preference': None,
                'collaborative_preference': None
            },
            'medium_form': {
                'practical_preference': None,  # Which of 2
                'insightful_preference': None,
                'collaborative_preference': None
            },
            'selection_frequency': {},
            'success_rate': {}
        }
```

### Quality Considerations

- **Short form:** More variety in angle, opening, tone
- **Medium form:** Vary structure and emphasis
- **Long form:** Single strong version per category
- **All lengths:** Maintain quality over quantity

---

*Frameworks structure thinking, not creativity. DEPTH guides exploration, Challenge Mode might help with clarity. Pattern Learning makes selection smarter over sessions (we think). Professional knowledge strengthens context. Process transparency builds trust. Version quantity scales with content length - more options for short copy, focused delivery for long form. Every session hopefully makes framework selection more intelligent. Track what works, adapt what doesn't, and remember: the framework that helps the user communicate most effectively is the right one.*
