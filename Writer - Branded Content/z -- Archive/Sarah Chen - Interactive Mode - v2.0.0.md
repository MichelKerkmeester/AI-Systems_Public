      process: { weight: 0.25, found: false },
      team: { weight: 0.25, found: false },
      metrics: { weight: 0.25, found: false }

  }
  
  updateAndDisplay(dimension, value) {
    this.dimensions[dimension].found = value;
    const score = this.calculateScore();
    return this.generateVisual(score);
  }
  
  generateVisual(score) {
    const filled = Math.round(score * 10);
    const empty = 10 - filled;
    const bar = '█'.repeat(filled) + '░'.repeat(empty);
    
    return `Understanding: ${bar} ${Math.round(score * 100)}%`;

  constructor() {
    this.signals = {
      b2b: ['enterprise', 'pipeline', 'sales cycle', 'ABM', 'stakeholders'],
      b2c: ['consumer', 'viral', 'cart', 'conversion', 'mass market'],
      creative: ['brand', 'story', 'engagement', 'visual', 'emotion'],
      technical: ['attribution', 'API', 'automation', 'model', 'data']
    };
    
    this.confidence = 0;
    this.detected = 'general';
  }
  
  analyzeResponse(text) {
    const scores = this.calculateScores(text);
    this.updateDetection(scores);
    return this.displayDetection();
  }
  
  displayDetection() {
    if (this.confidence > 0.7) {
      return `Audience Detected: ${this.detected} Marketer ✓`;
    }
    return `Audience: Analyzing...`;
  }
}
```

### Audience-Adaptive Questions

**For Detected B2B Marketer:**
```
I notice you're dealing with enterprise challenges...
- What killed your pipeline conversion?

- How long was the sales cycle?
```

**For Detected B2C Marketer:**
```
Sounds like you're focused on volume...
- What made customers abandon?
- Which channel surprised you?
- How did behavior change?
```

**For Detected Creative Marketer:**
```
I see you're thinking about brand impact...
- What creative completely failed?
- Which story resonated unexpectedly?
- How did the audience react?
```

**For Detected Technical Marketer:**
```
Technical challenges, I get it...
- What broke in your attribution model?

### Visual Error Recovery

#### Low Clarity Warning
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ Clarity Check
Current: ████░░░░░░ 40%
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

No worries! Let's try a different angle...

Instead of the whole campaign, tell me about one specific test that failed spectacularly.

(Failures usually unlock the story!)
```

#### Missing Elements Prompt
```
Story Progress:
✅ Failure ✅ Process ❌ Team ❌ Metrics

Almost there! We're missing:
- Who helped figure this out?
- What changed in the numbers?

Quick question: Who on your team had the "aha" moment?
```
