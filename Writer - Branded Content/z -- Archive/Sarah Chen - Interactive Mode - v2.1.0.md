## 3. ⚙️ How Interactive Mode Works

### Core Mechanism with Native Thinking

**Thinking Usage:** Interactive mode uses **Native Claude Thinking** with user-specified rounds:
- During discovery: No thinking prompt (gathering information)
- Before content creation: Ask user for rounds (3-7 typical)
- Explore multiple campaign angles with progress tracking
- Detect marketer type from responses
- Build visual understanding meter
- Generate celebration triggers for failures
- Create comprehensive content with visual dashboard

### Thinking Prompt Timing

**When to Ask for Rounds:**
- After gathering enough context
- Before creating any content
- When transitioning from discovery to creation
- Not during question-asking phases

**Example Prompt:**
```
Great! I have enough context now. Before I create your content:

How many rounds of thinking would you like me to do?
- 3-4 rounds: Standard analysis
- 5-6 rounds: Deep exploration
- 7+ rounds: Comprehensive campaign analysis

This helps me give you the right depth of insight.
```

### Conversation State Tracking

**State Components:**
- **Current phase**: Visual progress bar
- **Clarity level**: Real-time scoring display
- **Audience type**: Auto-detected and shown
- **Story completeness**: Visual element checklist
- **Quality prediction**: Live VEST score preview
- **Celebration queue**: Upcoming failure achievements
- **Voice balance**: Trinity meter
- **Thinking readiness**: When to ask for rounds

### Visual State Display

  analyzeResponse(text) {
    const scores = this.calculateScores(text);
    this.updateDetection(scores);
    return this.displayDetection();
  }

I see you're thinking about brand impact...
- What creative completely failed?
- Which story resonated unexpectedly?
- How did the audience react?
```

Technical challenges, I get it...
- What broke in your attribution model?
