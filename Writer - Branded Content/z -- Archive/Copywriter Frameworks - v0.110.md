# Personal Branding - Marketing Frameworks

## ⚠️ CRITICAL USAGE NOTE

**IMPORTANT:** These frameworks work in conjunction with the main system. Frameworks are guides, not rigid rules—adapt based on context while maintaining Sarah's authentic voice.

### FRAMEWORK EXEMPTIONS:
- Single sentence edits
- Simple tone adjustments
- Quick social responses
- Email signatures
- Ad copy tweaks

**For these cases:** Write naturally without framework selection.

### Keyword Matching Warning:
**Never assume framework needs based on keywords:**
- "problem" → Does NOT automatically mean PAS framework
- "story" → Does NOT automatically mean STORY framework
- "help" → Does NOT automatically mean HELP framework

## 3. 📝 WRITING FRAMEWORKS

### 🟢 SIMPLE FRAMEWORKS (3-Part) - 5-10 minutes

#### **SVC** → Situation • Value • Connection
**When:** Daily insights, marketing observations, quick lessons

```
Situation: "Client insisted on 'professional' stock photos"
Value: "Real employee photos increased CTR by 47%"
Connection: "When did your brand last audit its visual authenticity?"
```

**Example Output:**

### Most concise:
Stock photos killed our CTR. Real employees: +47%. You?

### Most authentic:
Client fought us on using employee photos vs stock. We A/B tested anyway. Real faces won by 47%. Sometimes "unprofessional" is exactly what people want. When's your last visual audit?

### Most valuable:
Marketing truth: We replaced stock photos with real employee shots. CTR jumped 47%, cost per lead dropped 31%. Test: Swap one hero image for authentic photo. Track for 2 weeks. Share results?

---

#### **QPT** → Question • Perspective • Takeaway
**When:** Starting conversations, challenging assumptions

```
Question: "Why do we still interrupt people with pop-ups?"
Perspective: "Exit intent increased conversions, immediate pop-ups killed them"
Takeaway: "Respect attention to earn engagement"
```

---

#### **DER** → Do • Example • Result
**When:** Quick tactics, practical tips

```
Do: "Add customer quotes to abandoned cart emails"
Example: "'I was skeptical but...' - Sarah, verified buyer"
Result: "28% recovery rate vs 15% baseline"
```

Context: "B2B SaaS, 6-month sales cycle, losing to competitors"
Action: "Created comparison content addressing every objection"
Stakes: "$2M pipeline at risk"
Evolution: "Win rate jumped from 23% to 41%"
```

---

#### **PATH** → Problem • Approach • Twist • Harvest
**When:** Showing process, methodology stories

```
Problem: "Email open rates tanking across all segments"
Approach: "Tested everything: subject lines, timing, sender names"
Twist: "Issue was email authentication, not content"
Harvest: "Technical foundations matter as much as creative"
```

---

#### **REAL** → Recognize • Explore • Apply • Learn
**When:** Problem-solving content, strategic thinking

Yes-And: "Now teaching other local businesses the model"
```

## 4. 🎨 TONE APPLICATION TO FRAMEWORKS

### Tone Combination Effects
Each tone changes HOW you execute a framework, not WHICH framework you choose:

#### **Framework + Tone Combinations Matrix**
| Framework | + Natural | + Casual | + Technical | + Educational | + Minimal |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **SVC** | Authentic insight | Personal story | Specific metrics | Learning moment | Sharp observation |
| **QPT** | Genuine question | Coffee chat question | Technical challenge | Teaching question | Direct inquiry |
| **CASE** | Real campaign story | Behind-scenes story | Implementation details | Step-by-step learning | Results summary |
| **DER** | Practical tip | Quick hack | Method with data | Teaching tactic | Action only |
| **PATH** | Journey with uncertainty | Adventure narrative | Process documentation | Learning progression | Solution path |
| **STORY** | Human transformation | Character-driven tale | System evolution | Growth narrative | Impact story |

### Quick Tone Selection:
- **Audience unclear?** → Default to $natural
- **Mixed audience?** → Use $educational  
- **Technical audience?** → Add $technical as secondary
- **Social platforms?** → Sprinkle $casual carefully
- **Ad copy needs?** → Switch to $minimal

### Tone Implementation Tips:
- **$natural**: Keep conversational rough edges, express genuine uncertainty
- **$casual**: Add personality and humor, but maintain Sarah's voice
- **$technical**: Focus on methodologies and specific metrics
- **$educational**: Use progressive teaching structure
- **$minimal**: Strip to essential impact words only

## 6. 🎯 COMMON MARKETING SCENARIOS

| Scenario | Framework | Opening |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Campaign launch | CASE | "6 months ago, our pipeline was..." |
| Monday motivation | SVC | "Weekend insight that changed..." |
| Failed campaign | PATH | "We spent $50K to learn..." |
| Tool review | REAL | "After 30 days with [tool]..." |
| Industry observation | QPT | "Why are we still..." |
| Success story | CASE | "From 2% to 12% conversion..." |
| Teaching moment | HELP | "The framework that doubled..." |

---

## 7. ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

### Framework Anti-patterns:
- Using STORY for quick tips → Use DER
- CASE without specific metrics → Always include numbers
- QPT without genuine curiosity → Must be authentic question
- GUIDE for simple tactics → Use HELP instead

### Quick Fixes:
| Wrong | Right |
|-------|--------|
| "Revolutionary approach..." | "Tested method that worked..." |
| "Best practices say..." | "In our experience..." |
| "Crushing it..." | "Exceeded targets by X%..." |
| "Growth hacking..." | "Sustainable growth through..." |

---

## 8. 🚀 QUICK REFERENCE

**10-Second Framework Pick:**
1. **Quick insight?** → SVC
2. **Campaign story?** → CASE
3. **Starting discussion?** → QPT
4. **Teaching something?** → HELP
5. **Can't decide?** → SVC

**Framework First Lines:**
- **SVC:** "Just noticed..."
- **CASE:** "Last quarter we..."
- **QPT:** "Why do we still..."
- **DER:** "Quick tip:..."
- **PATH:** "Here's how we..."
- **STORY:** "Three years ago..."

### Emergency Framework Pivots:
- Started with STORY but too long? → Switch to CASE
- QPT not working? → Flip to SVC with question at end
- HELP too preachy? → Reframe as PATH (your journey)

*Remember: Frameworks give structure to insights, not restrictions to voice. When forced, write naturally. The best marketing content helps someone market better today.*
