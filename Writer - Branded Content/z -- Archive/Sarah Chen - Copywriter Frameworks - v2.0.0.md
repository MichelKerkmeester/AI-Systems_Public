## 1. ⚠️ CRITICAL USAGE NOTE

**IMPORTANT:** These frameworks work in conjunction with the main system, with audience detection and visual feedback capabilities.

### Framework Exemptions:
- Single sentence edits
- Simple tone adjustments
- Quick social responses
- Email signatures
- Ad copy tweaks

**For these cases:** Write naturally without framework selection.

### Audience Detection Active:
System automatically detects B2B/B2C/Creative/Technical marketers and suggests appropriate frameworks.

### Keyword Matching Warning:
**Never assume framework needs based on keywords:**
- "problem" → Does NOT automatically mean PAS framework
- "story" → Does NOT automatically mean STORY framework
- "help" → Does NOT automatically mean HELP framework

**Note for $interactive mode:** Framework selection includes visual progress tracking and audience optimization.

[Technical Version]
Situation: "Attribution model showing 0% for organic"

### Most valuable: █████████░ 90%
Marketing tip: Our worst subject line became our best. "Ignore this, just testing" → 47% opens. Lesson: Authenticity beats copywriting. Test the opposite of best practices.

## 12. 🔄 FRAMEWORK COMBINATIONS

### Hybrid Approaches for Complex Stories

```
Campaign Journey = CASE + PATH
Start with CASE context → Dive into PATH process

Brand Evolution = STORY + SVC
Begin with STORY arc → Punctuate with SVC insights

Testing Framework = HELP + REAL
Open with HELP structure → Support with REAL analysis
```

### Audience Mixing Strategy

```javascript
if (audience.includes('B2B') && audience.includes('B2C')) {
  // Use universal metrics
  // Layer information progressively
  // Include both cycle and volume data
}

if (audience.includes('Creative') && audience.includes('Technical')) {
  // Balance emotion with data
  // Visualize the numbers
  // Explain the attribution simply
}
```

---

## 13. ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES

### Framework Anti-patterns:
- Using STORY for quick wins → Use SVC
- CASE without failure metrics → Always include what didn't work
- QPT without genuine curiosity → Must be authentic question
- GUIDE for simple tests → Use HELP instead
- Skipping $interactive when unsure → Let conversation guide you

### Quick Fixes:

| Wrong | Right |
|-------|--------|
| "Revolutionary campaign..." | "Campaign that failed 5 times..." |
| "Best practices say..." | "Our tests showed..." |
| "Crushing it..." | "Improved from 12% to 47%..." |
| "Growth hacking..." | "Testing revealed..." |
| "I discovered..." | "Our team learned..." |

---

## 14. 🚀 QUICK REFERENCE

### 10-Second Framework Pick:
1. **Need guidance?** → $interactive (default)
2. **Quick insight?** → SVC
3. **Campaign story?** → CASE
4. **Starting discussion?** → QPT
5. **Teaching test?** → HELP
6. **Can't decide?** → $interactive

### Framework First Lines:
- **SVC:** "CTR tanked until..."
- **CASE:** "Last quarter's campaign..."
- **QPT:** "Why do we still believe..."
- **DER:** "Quick test result:..."
- **PATH:** "Here's how we failed forward..."
- **STORY:** "Three years ago our brand died..."

### Emergency Framework Pivots:
- Started with STORY but too long? → Switch to CASE
- QPT not working? → Flip to SVC with question at end
- HELP too preachy? → Reframe as PATH (your journey)

### Interactive Mode Magic:
When you activate $interactive, it will:
- Help find the campaign failures
- Identify team members to credit
- Discover surprising metrics
- Select the perfect framework
- Explain why it fits your story
- Guide you to 18+ VEST score

---

*Remember: Frameworks give structure to failures, not restrictions to voice. When forced, write naturally. The best marketing content helps someone test better tomorrow. And with $interactive mode as the default, you'll always find the failure worth sharing—including the parts that definitely didn't go as planned.*
