## ‚ö†Ô∏è Reality Check

### The Truth About Webflow MCP
The Webflow MCP is a powerful **content management tool**, not a **site builder**. It excels at managing content within existing structures but cannot create those structures.

**Correct Positioning:**
> "I manage your Webflow content brilliantly after you've set up the structure in Designer."

### Version 3.0 Improvements
- More transparent about limitations upfront
- Better guidance when Designer is needed
- Clearer workaround suggestions
- Improved pattern recognition

.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create a Claude Project
1. Go to claude.ai
2. Click "Projects" in sidebar
3. Click "Create project"
4. Name it "Webflow Agent"

### Step 2: Add System Instructions
1. In your project, click "Edit project details"
2. Find "Custom instructions" section
3. Copy and paste: `Agent - MCP - Webflow - v0.300.md`
4. Save the project

### Step 3: Upload Reference Documents
Add these 5 essential documents to your project:
- `Agent - MCP - Webflow - v0.300.md` (Main agent)
- `Webflow - MCP Knowledge - v0.300.md` (Central knowledge)
- `Webflow - Interactive Intelligence - v0.300.md` (Conversation patterns)
- `Webflow - Patterns & Workflows - v0.300.md` (Operation mappings)
- `Webflow - ATLAS Thinking Framework - v0.200.md` (Reality-based thinking)
- `README.md` (This guide)

### Step 4: Prepare Your Webflow Structure
**IMPORTANT: Before using the agent:**
1. Create your collections in Webflow Designer
2. Add all needed fields to collections
3. Set up any relationships
4. Publish the structure
5. Get your API key from [Webflow Account Settings](https://webflow.com/dashboard/account/apps)

### Step 5: Start Managing Content
With structure ready, you can now:
```
update all blog posts
create product in existing collection
publish to production
update SEO metadata
manage draft content
```

The system will transparently tell you if something needs Designer first!

.

## üß† How It Works

### Reality-Based Intent Recognition

The system checks every request against actual capabilities:

| Request Type | Can Do? | Response | Action |
|-------------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Content Update** | ‚úÖ Yes | "I can update that!" | Execute |
| **Field Creation** | ‚ùå No | "Add in Designer first" | Guide |
| **Publishing** | ‚úÖ Yes | "Publishing now!" | Execute |
| **Image Upload** | ‚ùå No | "Use external URLs" | Workaround |
| **SEO Update** | ‚úÖ Yes | "Updating metadata!" | Execute |
| **Page Creation** | ‚ùå No | "Create in Designer" | Guide |

### Capability-Aware Conversation

**High Clarity ‚Üí Quick Execution (if possible):**
```
User: "update product prices"
System: "I can update prices in your existing products!

Processing...
‚úÖ Updated 47 products
Time: 23 seconds"
```

**Structural Request ‚Üí Designer Guidance:**
```
User: "add featured image field"
System: "I cannot create fields through the API.

To add a featured image field:
1. Open Webflow Designer
2. Go to your collection settings
3. Add new field ‚Üí Image type
4. Name it 'featured_image'
5. Publish changes

Once added, I can populate it with image URLs!"
```

**Workaround Offered:**
```
User: "upload product images"
System: "I cannot upload images directly. Here are your options:

1. Use external hosting (Cloudinary/S3)
2. Upload via Designer's Asset Manager
3. Provide direct URLs

Which approach works for you?"
```

.

## üí¨ Example Interactions

### Successful Content Management
```
User: update all blog post meta descriptions

System: How many thinking rounds should I use? (1-10)
Recommended: 3 rounds (bulk operation)

User: 3

System: I can update all meta descriptions!

Checking your Blog Posts collection...
‚úÖ Found: 52 posts
‚úÖ Field exists: meta_description

Updating all posts...
[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà] 100%

‚úÖ Updated 52 meta descriptions
Time: 26 seconds
API calls: 52/60

Ready to publish these changes?
```

### Structure Creation (Not Possible)
```
User: create a blog with categories and authors

System: I need to clarify my capabilities:

‚ùå What I CANNOT do:
‚Ä¢ Create new collections
‚Ä¢ Add fields to collections
‚Ä¢ Set up relationships

‚úÖ What I CAN do (after Designer setup):
‚Ä¢ Create and manage blog posts
‚Ä¢ Assign categories and authors
‚Ä¢ Handle publishing
‚Ä¢ Optimize SEO

To proceed, first create in Designer:
1. Blog Posts collection with fields
2. Categories collection
3. Authors collection
4. Reference fields linking them

Then I can manage all your content!
```

### Bulk Operations (Within Limits)
```
User: import 50 products

System: I can create products in your existing collection!

Checking Products collection...
‚úÖ Collection exists
‚úÖ Required fields present

Note: Images must be external URLs (I cannot upload files)

Creating 50 products...
[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà] 100%

‚úÖ Import complete!
‚Ä¢ 50 products created
‚Ä¢ All in draft status
‚Ä¢ Time: 90 seconds

Ready to publish?
```

.

## üìä What Gets Managed

### Content Within Existing Structures

**Blog Management (structure must exist):**
```
Prerequisites (Designer):
‚úÖ Blog Posts collection exists
‚úÖ All fields created
‚úÖ Categories collection exists
‚úÖ Relationships defined

What I Can Do:
‚Ä¢ Create new posts (3s each)
‚Ä¢ Update existing posts (2s each)
‚Ä¢ Assign categories (1s)
‚Ä¢ Update SEO metadata (2s)
‚Ä¢ Publish to live (3s)
‚Ä¢ Bulk operations (1-2s per item)
```

**E-commerce Management:**
```
Prerequisites (Designer):
‚úÖ Products collection exists
‚úÖ All product fields created
‚úÖ Categories set up
‚úÖ Images hosted externally

What I Can Do:
‚Ä¢ Update product information
‚Ä¢ Manage inventory
‚Ä¢ Update pricing
‚Ä¢ Assign categories
‚Ä¢ Publish changes

Cannot Do:
‚Ä¢ Upload product images
‚Ä¢ Create variant fields
‚Ä¢ Add new attributes
```

.

## üîß Installing Webflow MCP (Required)

The Webflow Agent requires the Webflow MCP tool to function.

### Option A: AI-Powered Docker Setup (Recommended)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker Desktop installed ([Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- Claude Desktop app ([Download Claude](https://claude.ai/download))
- Webflow API key from [Webflow Account Settings](https://webflow.com/dashboard/account/apps)

**AI-Assisted Installation:**

Copy this prompt to Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant:

```
Help me set up Docker container for Webflow MCP.

Repository: https://github.com/webflow/mcp-server-webflow.git
API key: [YOUR_WEBFLOW_KEY]
Directory: "$HOME/MCP Servers/webflow"
OS: [Windows/Mac/Linux]

Need: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and Claude Desktop config.
```

### Option B: NPX Setup (Quick but Less Stable)

Add to Claude Desktop config:

**Config Location:**
- Mac/Linux: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "webflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@webflow/mcp-server-webflow"],
      "env": {
        "WEBFLOW_API_KEY": "your-webflow-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

.
