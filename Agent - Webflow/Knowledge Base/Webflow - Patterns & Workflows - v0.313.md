## 1. 🎯 OVERVIEW

This document defines pattern recognition and workflow orchestration for natural language Webflow requests. All patterns use native Webflow APIs exclusively with automatic UltraThink processing - no custom code generation.

### Pattern Categories
- **Connection Verification** - Always check MCP first
- **Intent Recognition** - What user wants to achieve
- **Structure Creation** - Collections and fields (native)
- **Component Building** - Visual elements (native)
- **Content Management** - CRUD operations
- **Complete Workflows** - Multi-step processes
- **Emergency Recovery** - Quick commands
- **UltraThink Processing** - Automatic 10 rounds

### Core Pattern Principle
```markdown
Every Pattern Follows:

1. Verify MCP connection
2. Apply UltraThink automatically (10 rounds)
3. Identify native API approach
4. Reject custom code requests
5. Execute with Webflow APIs
6. Provide native solutions only
7. Never ask about thinking depth
```

---

## 2. 📌 CONNECTION PATTERNS

### Initial Connection Pattern
```yaml
Pattern: Connection Verification
Priority: ALWAYS FIRST
Processing: Before UltraThink
Steps:
  1. Check MCP server status
  2. Run test query (sites_list)
  3. Verify authentication
  4. Check companion app if needed
  5. Begin UltraThink processing
  6. Proceed or apply REPAIR
```

### Connection States

| State | Pattern | Action | Next | Thinking |
|-------|---------|--------|------|----------|
| Connected | Proceed | Execute request | Native ops | UltraThink |
| Disconnected | REPAIR | Restart Claude | Re-verify | N/A |
| Auth Failed | REPAIR | Re-authorize | Re-verify | N/A |
| App Missing | Conditional | Check if Designer needed | Proceed/Launch | UltraThink |

### Recovery Patterns
```markdown
Connection Lost Pattern:

Trigger: Any API call fails
Response:
  1. Immediate connection check
  2. Apply REPAIR protocol
  3. Guide user to fix
  4. Re-verify before retry
  5. Resume with UltraThink
  6. Never attempt without connection
```

## 8. 🧠 THINKING PATTERNS

### Automatic Depth System (No User Interaction)

| Operation | UltraThink | $quick Mode | Pre-Req |
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Simple update | 10 rounds | 1-2 rounds | Connection ✔ |
| Create collection | 10 rounds | 2-3 rounds | Connection ✔ |
| Build component | 10 rounds | 3-4 rounds | Connection + App ✔ |
| Design page | 10 rounds | 4-5 rounds | Connection + App ✔ |
| Full site | 10 rounds | 5 rounds (max) | All verified ✔ |

### Processing Display Patterns
```markdown
Standard Processing (Default):

✔ Connection verified
✔ UltraThink activated
✔ Never asks user
✔ Shows: "Processing with UltraThink..."
✔ Executes with 10 rounds
```

```markdown
Quick Mode Processing ($quick):

✔ Connection verified
✔ Adaptive thinking
✔ Never asks user
✔ Shows: "⚡ Quick Mode: Processing..."
✔ Executes with 1-5 rounds
```

### Never Ask Pattern
```markdown
BLOCKED PATTERNS - Never Execute:

✗ "How many thinking rounds?"
✗ "Choose your depth (1-10)"
✗ "Would you like deep analysis?"
✗ "Select processing level"
✗ Any variation of thinking questions

ALWAYS INSTEAD:

✔ Apply UltraThink silently
✔ Show "Processing..." message
✔ Execute immediately
```

### Thinking Pattern Flow
```markdown
Connection Verified
    ↓
UltraThink Activated Automatically
    ↓
"Processing with UltraThink..."
    ↓
Execute with native APIs
    ↓
Deliver results
```
