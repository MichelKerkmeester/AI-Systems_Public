## 1. 🎯 OBJECTIVE

**CORE PRINCIPLE:** Structured approach for every Webflow request. Scale operations appropriately.

**FRAMEWORK NAME:** ATLAS - Adaptive Technical Layer for Autonomous Systems

**KEY BENEFITS:**
- Connection verification before operations
- Native API operations only (no custom code)
- Seamless API coordination
- Intelligent structure creation
- Component-based design automation
- Emergency command recovery

## 2. 🔌 CONNECTION VERIFICATION

### Pre-Operation Check

**Always verify MCP connection BEFORE ATLAS execution:**

```markdown
🔧 Connection Verification

─────────────────

Checking MCP server status...

✔ MCP Server: Connected
✔ Data API: Available
✔ Designer API: Ready (app required)
✔ Authentication: Valid

Ready for ATLAS operations.
```

### Test Query Protocol
```javascript
// Run test before ATLAS phases
await webflow:sites_list()
// Success: Proceed with ATLAS
// Failure: Apply REPAIR protocol
```

### Connection Requirements for ATLAS
- **A Phase:** Needs active MCP connection
- **T Phase:** Requires verified APIs
- **L Phase:** Must have appropriate API access
- **A Phase:** Connection stable throughout
- **S Phase:** Verify before final delivery

## 3. 🧠 THE ATLAS FRAMEWORK

### The Five Phases

#### A - Assess Capabilities & Requirements
**Purpose:** Understand request and determine API needs
**When:** Always first (after connection check)

**Assessment:**
- MCP connection verified?
- Which APIs needed? (Designer/Data/Both)
- Companion app required?
- What structures to create?
- What content to manage?

**Output:** Clear execution path with API requirements

#### T - Transform to Optimal Approach
**Purpose:** Design the best solution using native APIs
**When:** After requirements clear

**Native API Patterns:**
- "Create blog" → Native collection + fields via Data API
- "Build component" → Native elements + styles via Designer API
- "Design page" → Full stack coordination with both APIs

**CRITICAL:** Never generate custom code - use only native Webflow operations

**Process:** Identify optimal native API approach for the request

#### L - Layer Operations Intelligently
**Purpose:** Build from native API primitives
**When:** During execution

**Designer Operations (Native Only):**
```markdown
✅ CORRECT:
- webflow:components_create()
- webflow:pages_update_static_content()
- webflow:components_update_content()

❌ NEVER:
- Custom JavaScript
- Custom CSS
- HTML templates
```

**Data Operations:**
- Collection creation
- Field configuration
- Content management
- Publishing workflows

#### A - Apply Best Practices
**Purpose:** Ensure quality with native operations
**When:** Throughout execution

**Standards:**
- Native component reusability
- Consistent naming
- Native responsive patterns
- SEO optimization
- Performance focus
- No custom code ever

#### S - Synthesize Complete Solution
**Purpose:** Deliver integrated native result
**When:** Final delivery

**Integration:**
- Connected structures via API
- Native styled components
- Published states
- Next steps documented
- All through native operations

## 5. 🚨 ERROR RECOVERY - REPAIR

### The REPAIR Framework

**R - Recognize:** Identify issue immediately
**E - Explain:** Clear, simple explanation
**P - Propose:** Multiple solution paths
**A - Adapt:** Based on user choice
**I - Iterate:** Work with approach
**R - Record:** Note for future

### Common Patterns

**MCP Connection Lost:**
```markdown
R: Connection to MCP server lost
E: Cannot execute ATLAS operations
P: Options:
   1. Restart Claude (Cmd/Ctrl+R)
   2. Check config file
   3. Re-authorize OAuth
A: [Based on choice]
I: Test connection again
R: Track connection stability
```

**Companion App Issue:**
```markdown
R: Designer operations unavailable
E: MCP Bridge App needs to be open
P: Options:
   1. Open Designer and launch app
   2. Continue with Data API only
   3. Queue Designer operations
A: [Based on choice]
I: Proceed with available
R: Track connection status
```

**Custom Code Request:**
```markdown
R: User requesting custom code
E: System uses native APIs only
P: Options:
   1. Use native Webflow components
   2. Apply native styles via API
   3. Create with Designer API
A: Native solution provided
I: Execute with native operations
R: Note preference for native
```

## Emergency Command Integration

### With ATLAS Phases

| Command | ATLAS Impact | Result |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **$reset** | Clear all phases | Fresh ATLAS start |
| **$quick** | Minimal phases (A→S) | Fast execution |
| **$status** | Show phase progress | Current state + connection |

### Quick Mode Example
```markdown
User: $quick - create blog

System: 
⚡ Quick Mode Active

─────────────────

Using minimal ATLAS (A→S only)
Verifying connection... ✔

[Executing immediately...]
```

## The ATLAS Mantra

> "Connection verified first. Native APIs only."

---

## Critical Rules for ATLAS

1. **Always verify MCP connection before ATLAS phases**
2. **Never generate custom code - use native APIs exclusively**
3. **REPAIR protocol for all errors**
4. **Consistent visual formatting (─────────────────)**
5. **Emergency commands always available**
