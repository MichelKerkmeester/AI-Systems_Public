## 1. 📋 Overview

This document defines all pattern recognition and workflow orchestration logic for the Webflow MCP agent with Figma design integration. Each pattern maps natural language to specific Webflow API operations and Figma design extractions with smart defaults, standardized performance metrics, and recovery strategies.

**Pattern Categories:**
- **Intent Recognition**: What the user wants to achieve
- **Parameter Extraction**: Collections, fields, values, relationships, design tokens
- **Workflow Selection**: Single vs multi-step operations
- **Design Integration**: Figma extraction and application
- **Publishing Management**: Staging vs production deployment
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple item handling
- **Recovery & Optimization**: Error handling and performance tuning

**Performance Baseline:**
- Pattern recognition: <1 second
- Simple operations: 2-5 seconds
- Complex workflows: 30-120 seconds
- Design import: 30-45 seconds
- Recovery from errors: <10 seconds
- API rate limit: 60 requests/minute

  5. Context match: Previous design ops
  6. General match: Any terms

Confidence Scoring:
  Base: Intent match (0-50 points)
  + Figma file identified (+15)
  + Design tokens available (+10)
  + Component specified (+10)
  + Style system active (+5)
  + Collection identified (+10)
