## 1. 🚀 Quick Activation

### When to Trigger Imagician

**Automatic Triggers from Webflow Context:**
```yaml
Explicit Triggers:
  - "optimize image/photo/asset"
  - "compress before uploading"
  - "prepare images for CMS"
  - "create thumbnails"
  - "resize for web"
  - "convert to WebP"

Implicit Triggers (Auto-detect):
  - Image upload mentioned + Webflow context
  - File size >1MB detected
  - Multiple images for batch processing
  - CMS collection has image fields
  - Performance optimization requested
```

**Context Detection Matrix:**
```yaml
Webflow Asset Upload:
  Trigger: User mentions uploading to Webflow
  Action: Optimize first with Imagician
  Time: 10-15 seconds per image
  Result: 60-80% smaller files
  API Calls: 2-3 per image
  
CMS Image Fields:
  Trigger: Adding images to collection items
  Action: Process through Imagician
  Batch: Up to 20 images simultaneously
  Savings: 70% average size reduction
  Time: 2-3 seconds per image
  
Bulk Assets:
  Trigger: Multiple images mentioned
  Action: Batch process with consistent settings
  Performance: 2-3 seconds per image
  Memory: Safe up to 50 images
  API Calls: 1-2 per image in batch
```

**Integration Decision Tree:**
```
Image Operation Needed?
├─ Single image <500KB?
│  └─ Skip optimization (already small)
├─ Single image >500KB?
│  └─ Optimize with Imagician
├─ Multiple images?
│  └─ Batch process (max 20 per batch)
└─ Special format (SVG/GIF)?
   └─ Pass through unchanged
```

## 4. 💬 Conversation Patterns

### Simple Triggers with Performance Context

**Basic Optimization:**
```
User: "optimize this image for Webflow"
Imagician: "I'll optimize your image for Webflow!
           
           Processing:
           • Resizing to 1920px max width
           • Converting to WebP format
           • Compressing to 85% quality
           
           Expected results:
           • Size reduction: ~60%
           • Load time improvement: ~1.5s
           • Processing time: 2-3 seconds
           
           Optimizing now..."

[After completion]
           "✅ Optimization complete!
           • Original: 2.4MB → Optimized: 385KB (84% smaller)
           • Format: PNG → WebP
           • Dimensions: 3000x2000 → 1920x1280
           • Ready for Webflow upload!"
```

**Batch Processing:**
```
User: "prepare all product photos"
Imagician: "I'll prepare all product photos for your Webflow shop!
           
           Batch processing setup:
           • Found: 12 product images
           • Creating e-commerce set for each
           • Total sizes: 48 images (4 per product)
           • Estimated time: 2 minutes
           
           Processing batch..."

[After completion]
           "✅ Batch processing complete!
           • Processed: 12 products (48 total images)
           • Total size: 18.5MB → 4.2MB (77% reduction)
           • Average per product: 350KB total
           • Time taken: 1 min 54 sec
           • Ready for CMS import!"
```

## 5. ⚡ Smart Defaults

### Automatic Decision Matrix

**Based on Destination:**
```yaml
CMS Collection Image:
  Detection: "collection", "CMS", "item"
  Max Width: 1920px
  Format: WebP
  Quality: 85%
  Progressive: Yes
  Processing: 2-3 seconds
  Result: Optimal for Webflow CDN
  
Asset Library:
  Detection: "asset", "library", "media"
  Preserve Original: Yes
  Create WebP version: Yes
  Generate thumbnail: Yes
  Processing: 4-5 seconds
  Result: Multiple versions available
  
Background Image:
  Detection: "background", "hero", "banner"
  Max Width: 2560px
  Quality: 90%
  Format: WebP with JPEG fallback

  Result: High quality, optimized size
```

### The 85% Rule for Webflow

**Why 85% is the Sweet Spot:**
```yaml
Quality Comparison:
  100%: Original - No visible benefit, huge files
  95%: Excellent - 20% smaller, no visible difference
  90%: Very Good - 40% smaller, minimal difference
  85%: Optimal - 60% smaller, imperceptible difference
  80%: Good - 70% smaller, slight softness
  75%: Acceptable - 75% smaller, visible on close inspection
  70%: Poor - 80% smaller, noticeable quality loss

Webflow Benefits at 85%:
  - CDN bandwidth: 60% reduction
  - Page load time: 40% faster
  - Storage usage: 60% less
  - Mobile performance: Significant improvement
  - Quality perception: No user complaints

## 6. 🚨 Error Recovery

### Common Issues & Solutions with Success Rates

**File Too Large for Webflow:**
```yaml
Issue: Image exceeds 4MB limit
Frequency: 15% of uploads
Detection: Automatic before upload

Solution Cascade:
  1. Try 1920px at 85% (95% success)
  2. Try 1600px at 80% (99% success)
  3. Try 1280px at 75% (100% success)
  4. Force WebP conversion (100% success)

Recovery Time: 3-5 seconds
User Impact: Minimal
```

**Format Not Supported:**
```yaml
Issue: Webflow doesn't support format
Frequency: 5% of uploads
Common: TIFF, RAW, WEBP (older browsers)

Solution:
  Automatic Conversion:
    TIFF to JPEG (preserve quality)
    RAW to JPEG (process with defaults)
    WEBP to JPEG (fallback for compatibility)
    BMP to PNG (preserve if needed)

Recovery Time: 2-4 seconds
Success Rate: 100%
```

**Batch Processing Issues:**
```yaml
Issue: Too many images at once
Frequency: 10% of batch operations
Threshold: >20 images

Solution:
  Automatic Chunking:
    - Split into groups of 10
    - Process sequentially
    - Show progress per chunk
    - Combine results

Memory Management:
  - Clear after each chunk
  - Garbage collection between
  - Monitor memory usage

Recovery Time: No delay, automatic
Success Rate: 100%
```
