## 1. üöÄ Quick Activation

### When to Trigger Figma MCP

**Automatic Triggers from Webflow Context:**
```yaml
Explicit Triggers:
  - "import from Figma"
  - "apply design system"
  - "sync with mockup"
  - "extract styles"
  - "get design specs"
  - "update from prototype"
  - "check design tokens"
  - "import components"

Implicit Triggers (Auto-detect):
  - Design file URL mentioned
  - Component creation requested
  - Style system needed
  - Typography setup mentioned
  - Color palette required
  - When consistency check needed
```

**Context Detection Matrix:**
```yaml
Design Import:
  Trigger: Figma file shared or referenced
  Action: Extract complete design system
  Time: 30-45 seconds
  Coverage: Colors, typography, spacing, components
  API Calls: 15-25
  
Style Sync:
  Trigger: Design updates mentioned
  Action: Re-fetch latest styles
  Elements: Auto-detect changes
  Validation: Check consistency
  Time: 15-20 seconds
  API Calls: 8-12
  
Component Mapping:
  Trigger: Component creation requested
  Action: Map Figma to Webflow elements

## 4. üí¨ Conversation Patterns

### Simple Triggers with Performance Context

**Basic Design Import:**
```
User: "import my Figma design"
Figma MCP: "I'll import your Figma design system!
        
        Extracting from Figma:
        üé® File: Your Design System v2.0
        üìä Found: 12 colors, 8 text styles, 15 components
        ‚öôÔ∏è Processing: Colors, Typography, Spacing
        ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated time: 30-45 seconds
        
        Importing now...
        
        ‚úÖ Design system imported successfully!
        ‚Ä¢ Colors: 12 swatches created
        ‚Ä¢ Typography: 8 text styles mapped
        ‚Ä¢ Components: 15 symbols ready
        ‚Ä¢ Spacing: 8px grid applied
        
        Would you like to:
        ‚Ä¢ Apply to existing pages?
        ‚Ä¢ Create style guide?
        ‚Ä¢ Map to CMS templates?"
```

**Component Sync with Results:**
```
User: "sync button component"
Figma MCP: "Syncing button component from Figma!
        
        Component Analysis:
        üîç Component: Button
        üìã Variants: 4 detected
        üé® States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled
        
        Extracting properties:
        ‚Ä¢ Size variants: Small, Medium, Large
        ‚Ä¢ Style variants: Primary, Secondary, Ghost
        ‚Ä¢ Icons: Leading, Trailing options
        
        [Mapping to Webflow...]
        ‚úÖ Primary button class created
        ‚úÖ Size modifiers added
        ‚úÖ Hover states configured
        
        ‚úÖ Button component synced!
        ‚Ä¢ 12 total combinations available
        ‚Ä¢ All states functional
        ‚Ä¢ Responsive sizing applied
        ‚Ä¢ Time taken: 20 seconds
        
        Preview in Designer to test!"
```
