## 1. üéØ INTENT RECOGNITION PATTERNS

### Core Recognition Engine

**Pattern Matching Hierarchy:**
```
1. Exact Match (0.95+ confidence)
   "project tracker" ‚Üí PROJECT_TRACKING_PATTERN
   
2. Synonym Recognition (0.85+ confidence)
   "todo list" = "task list" = "action items" ‚Üí TASK_PATTERN
   
3. Category Detection (0.75+ confidence)
   "organize meetings" ‚Üí SCHEDULING_CATEGORY ‚Üí MEETING_PATTERN
   
4. Composite Understanding (0.70+ confidence)
   "client work tracker" ‚Üí CRM_PATTERN + PROJECT_PATTERN
   
5. Contextual Inference (0.60+ confidence)
   "track books" + user_is_student ‚Üí STUDY_MATERIALS_PATTERN
```

### Confidence Scoring Framework

**High Confidence Triggers (>0.8):**
- Contains exact pattern keywords
- Clear singular intent
- Common use case
- No conflicting indicators

**Medium Confidence Triggers (0.5-0.8):**
- Partial pattern match
- Multiple possible intents
- Requires context
- Some ambiguity

**Low Confidence Triggers (<0.5):**
- Vague language
- No pattern match
- Multiple interpretations
- Needs clarification

### Ambiguity Resolution Patterns

**Multiple Match Resolution:**
```
User: "tracker"
Matches: [task_tracker, habit_tracker, time_tracker, expense_tracker]

Resolution Strategy:
1. Check context for clues
2. Look for modifier words  
3. Consider user history
4. Ask clarifying question if needed
```

**Context Clue Detection:**
- Time-related words ‚Üí Time tracking
- Money/cost words ‚Üí Expense tracking
- Daily/routine words ‚Üí Habit tracking
- Work/project words ‚Üí Task tracking

## üéØ Pattern Application Guidelines

### Selection Logic
1. **Exact Match First**: Check primary triggers
2. **Context Analysis**: Look for modifying words
3. **User History**: Consider previous patterns
4. **Smart Defaults**: Apply when confidence high
5. **Ask When Unsure**: Single clarifying question

### Confidence Thresholds
- **>0.9**: Execute immediately with pattern
- **0.7-0.9**: Confirm understanding first
- **0.5-0.7**: Show options to user
- **<0.5**: Use interactive mode

### Pattern Combination Rules
- Compatible patterns can merge
- Conflicting patterns need resolution
- User intent overrides defaults
- Maintain simplicity when possible

### Quality Assurance
Every pattern implementation must:
- Include helpful views
- Apply best practices
- Scale appropriately
- Provide clear value
- Enable easy modification
