## 1. 📊 DATABASE VS PAGE DECISIONS

### Decision Framework

**Use a DATABASE when:**
- Information repeats with similar structure
- You need to sort, filter, or group
- Multiple views of same data needed
- Tracking items over time
- Relationships between items exist
- Calculations or rollups required

**Use a PAGE when:**
- Information is unique/one-off
- Long-form content
- Static reference material
- Hierarchical documentation
- No need for properties
- Simple note-taking

### Implementation Logic

```yaml
decision_tree:
  question_1: "Will there be multiple similar items?"
    yes: → DATABASE
    no: → Continue
    
  question_2: "Need to filter or sort?"
    yes: → DATABASE
    no: → Continue
    
  question_3: "Track properties/metadata?"
    yes: → DATABASE
    no: → PAGE
```

### Real-World Examples

**DATABASE Examples:**
```
✅ Task List - Multiple tasks with status, dates, owners
✅ Meeting Notes - Recurring structure, searchable
✅ Contact List - Consistent properties, relationships
✅ Content Calendar - Timeline views, status tracking
✅ Expense Tracker - Calculations, categories, reports
```

**PAGE Examples:**
```
✅ Company Wiki - Static information, hierarchical
✅ Project Brief - One-off document
✅ Strategy Doc - Long-form unique content
✅ Personal Journal Entry - Unstructured thoughts
✅ Reference Guide - Static how-to content
```

### Hybrid Approaches

**Page with Inline Databases:**
```
Project Hub Page
├── Overview (text)
├── Goals (text)
├── Tasks (inline database)
├── Resources (inline database)
└── Notes (text)
```

**Rationale**: Combines static context with dynamic tracking

**Database with Rich Pages:**
```
Knowledge Base Database
├── Each item opens to full page
├── Properties for categorization
├── Page content for detailed info
└── Best of both worlds
```

## 2. 🏷️ PROPERTY DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Essential Properties Framework

**Every Database Should Have:**
1. **Title** (required) - Clear, searchable names
2. **Status/State** - Where in process
3. **Date** - When relevant (created, due, etc.)
4. **Owner/Assignee** - Who's responsible
5. **Category/Type** - For grouping

### Property Type Selection

**Text vs Select:**
```yaml
use_select_when:
  - Finite set of options
  - Consistency matters
  - Want to group/filter by it
  - Color coding helpful

use_text_when:
  - Unique values each time
  - Long descriptions
  - No need to standardize
  - Search is primary use
```

**Single vs Multi-Select:**
```yaml
single_select:
  - Mutually exclusive options
  - Status, Priority, Type
  - "Item can only be one thing"

multi_select:
  - Multiple attributes apply
  - Tags, Skills, Features
  - "Item can be many things"
```

**Date Best Practices:**
```yaml
date_properties:
  single_date:
    - Due dates
    - Publish dates
    - Milestones
    
  date_range:
    - Project duration
    - Event span
    - Vacation periods
    
  include_time_when:
    - Meetings
    - Deadlines with specific time
    - Scheduling matters
```

### Formula Best Practices

**Common Useful Formulas:**

**Days Until Due:**
```
if(prop("Due Date"), 
  dateBetween(prop("Due Date"), now(), "days"), 
  empty())
```

**Automatic Status:**
```
if(prop("Complete"), "✅ Done",
  if(prop("Due Date") < now(), "⚠️ Overdue", 
    "⏳ Pending"))
```

**Progress Percentage:**
```
if(prop("Total Tasks") > 0,
  round(prop("Completed Tasks") / prop("Total Tasks") * 100),
  0)
```

### Relation Design Principles

**One-to-Many Relations:**
```yaml
example: "Project → Tasks"
setup:
  - Project has many tasks
  - Task belongs to one project
  - Name clearly: "Tasks" / "Project"
  
benefits:
  - See all tasks in project
  - Roll up task counts
  - Sum time estimates
```

**Many-to-Many Relations:**
```yaml
example: "Skills ↔ People"
setup:
  - People have multiple skills
  - Skills used by multiple people
  - Bidirectional viewing
  
considerations:
  - Can create complexity
  - Use when truly needed
  - Consider using tags instead
```

### Rollup Best Practices

**Common Rollup Patterns:**
```yaml
count_related:
  property: "Tasks"
  calculate: "Count all"
  use_case: "Total tasks per project"

sum_values:
  property: "Hours"
  calculate: "Sum"
  use_case: "Total time per project"

show_progress:
  property: "Status"
  calculate: "Percent checked"
  use_case: "Completion percentage"

latest_date:
  property: "Last Updated"
  calculate: "Latest date"
  use_case: "Most recent activity"
```

## 3. 🗂️ WORKSPACE ORGANIZATION

### Hierarchy Principles

**Optimal Structure Depth:**
```
✅ Good: 3 levels maximum
Workspace
├── Areas (Work, Personal, Resources)
│   ├── Projects
│   │   └── Databases & Pages
```

```
❌ Avoid: Deep nesting
Workspace
├── Department
│   ├── Team
│   │   ├── Sub-team
│   │   │   ├── Projects
│   │   │   │   └── Tasks (too deep!)
```

**Rationale**: Deep hierarchies make navigation difficult and mobile experience poor

### Naming Conventions

**Consistent Naming Patterns:**
```yaml
databases:
  prefix: "📊 Tasks", "📅 Calendar", "👥 Contacts"
  format: "[Emoji] [Plural Noun]"
  
projects:
  format: "[YYYY] Project Name"
  example: "2025 Website Redesign"
  
archives:
  format: "Archive - [Year/Type]"
  example: "Archive - 2024 Projects"
```

**Benefits:**
- Visual scanning improved
- Search more effective
- Sorting works naturally
- Professional appearance

### Area-Based Organization

**PARA Method Implementation:**
```
🏠 Workspace
├── 📌 Projects (active, time-bound)
├── 🎯 Areas (ongoing responsibilities)
├── 📚 Resources (future reference)
└── 🗄️ Archive (inactive items)
```

**GTD Implementation:**
```
🏠 Workspace
├── 📥 Inbox (capture)
├── 📋 Next Actions (by context)
├── 🗓️ Calendar (time-specific)
├── 🔄 Projects (multi-step)
├── 📌 Someday/Maybe
└── 📂 Reference
```

### Archive Strategies

**Time-Based Archiving:**
```yaml
quarterly_archive:
  schedule: Every 3 months
  criteria: 
    - Completed items
    - Inactive > 90 days
  structure: /Archive/2025/Q1/

yearly_archive:
  schedule: Annually
  criteria:
    - Previous year's data
  structure: /Archive/2024/
```

**Status-Based Archiving:**
```yaml
on_completion:
  trigger: Status = "Complete"
  delay: 30 days after completion
  location: /Archive/Completed/
  
maintain:
    - Relations
    - Properties
    - Comments
```

### Dashboard Design

**Effective Dashboard Components:**
```yaml
top_section:
  - Key metrics/KPIs
  - Quick actions
  - Today's focus

middle_section:
  - Active projects view
  - Upcoming deadlines
  - Recent updates

bottom_section:
  - Quick links
  - Resources
  - Archives access
```

**Dashboard Best Practices:**
- Limit to one screen of content
- Most important info at top
- Use linked database views
- Include visual breaks
- Mobile-responsive layout

## 4. 👁️ VIEW OPTIMIZATION

### Default View Principles

**Choose Default Based on Usage:**
```yaml
table_view_when:
  - Comparing multiple properties
  - Bulk editing needed
  - Data analysis focus
  - Desktop primary use

board_view_when:
  - Workflow/status focus
  - Visual task management
  - Drag-drop important
  - Team collaboration

calendar_view_when:
  - Date-driven work
  - Scheduling focus
  - Deadline management
  - Time-based planning

list_view_when:
  - Mobile primary use
  - Simple task lists
  - Reading-focused
  - Minimal properties
```

### Filter Best Practices

**Performance-Optimized Filters:**
```yaml
efficient_filters:
  - Filter by select/status (indexed)
  - Date ranges with boundaries
  - Simple AND conditions
  - Avoid complex OR chains

common_filters:
  active_items:
    - Status != "Complete"
    - AND Status != "Cancelled"
    
  my_items:
    - Assigned to = Me
    - OR Created by = Me
    
  this_period:
    - Date >= start_of_period()
    - AND Date <= end_of_period()
```

### Sort Strategies

**Multi-Level Sorting:**
```yaml
task_sort:
  1. Status (custom order)
  2. Priority (High → Low)
  3. Due Date (Ascending)
  
benefit: Urgent items bubble up naturally
```

**Custom Sort Orders:**
```yaml
status_order:
  - "🚨 Urgent"
  - "🏃 In Progress"
  - "📅 Planned"
  - "✅ Complete"
  - "❌ Cancelled"
```

### View Combinations

**Complementary View Sets:**
```yaml
project_views:
  - "Active" (table) - Overview
  - "Timeline" (calendar) - Scheduling
  - "By Status" (board) - Workflow
  - "My Projects" (table) - Personal filter

task_views:
  - "Today" (list) - Focus view
  - "This Week" (table) - Planning
  - "By Project" (board) - Context
  - "All Tasks" (table) - Complete list
```

```yaml
small_database: 
  items: < 1,000
  performance: Instant
  all_features: Available

medium_database:
  items: 1,000 - 10,000
  performance: Good
  consider: 
    - Filtered views
    - Archive strategy

large_database:
  items: 10,000 - 50,000
  performance: Slower
  requirements:
    - Aggressive filtering
    - Limited properties shown
    - Archive old data

very_large:
  items: > 50,000
  performance: Degraded
  solution: Split into multiple databases
```

**Optimization Techniques:**
```yaml
fast_views:
  - Show fewer properties (3-5)
  - Simple filters only
  - Limit visible items
  - Avoid heavy formulas

slow_patterns:
  - Many rollups/relations shown
  - Complex filter logic
  - All properties visible
  - Unconstrained date ranges
```

### Formula Optimization

**Efficient Formulas:**
```yaml
good_patterns:
  - Simple calculations
  - Direct property references
  - Minimal nesting
  - Avoid circular references

optimization_tips:
  - Calculate once, display many
  - Use rollups over formulas when possible
  - Limit formula chain depth
  - Cache complex calculations
```

### Relation Performance

**Best Practices:**
```yaml
efficient_relations:
  - Limit to necessary connections
  - Avoid circular relations
  - Use one-way when possible
  - Index on both sides

performance_impact:
  - Each relation adds overhead
  - Rollups multiply impact
  - Bi-directional doubles load

  guest_access: By invitation
```

### Collaborative Workflows

**Review Processes:**
```yaml
content_review:
  stages:
    - Draft (Author edits)
    - Review (Comments only)
    - Approved (Locked)
  
  implementation:
    - Status property drives permissions
    - Notify reviewers on status change
    - Lock when approved
```

**Team Task Management:**
```yaml
assignment_pattern:
  - Clear owner property
  - Status visibility
  - Comment for handoffs
  - @mentions for urgency
  
  best_practices:
    - One owner per task
    - Explicit handoff process
    - Status indicates action needed
```

### Communication Patterns

**Effective Use of Comments:**
```yaml
when_to_comment:
  - Questions about specific items
  - Status updates
  - Handoff notes
  - Decision documentation

when_not_to_comment:
  - General discussions (use pages)
  - Permanent information (use properties)
  - Sensitive data (use private pages)
```

## 9. 🎯 AUTOMATION PRINCIPLES

### Recurring Patterns

**Automated Creation:**
```yaml
daily_standup:
  trigger: Each weekday
  creates: Meeting note
  template: Standup template
  assigns: Team rotation

weekly_review:
  trigger: Friday afternoon
  creates: Review page
  includes: Week's accomplishments
  prepares: Next week's priorities
```

### Status Automation

**Workflow Automation:**
```yaml
date_based_status:
  overdue_check:
    if: Due date < today AND Status != "Complete"
    then: Add "⚠️ Overdue" tag
    
  auto_archive:
    if: Status = "Complete" for 30 days
    then: Move to archive

progress_tracking:
  if: All subtasks complete
  then: Parent status = "Ready for Review"
```

### Template Intelligence

**Smart Templates:**
```yaml
project_template:
  auto_populate:
    - Start date = today
    - Due date = start + duration
    - Owner = creator
    - Status = "Planning"
    
  create_related:
    - Standard subtasks
    - Meeting schedule
    - Resource allocation
```
